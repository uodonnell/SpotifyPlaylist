Satanic Slumber Party Part 1 (The Chairmanâ€™s Portrait) LyricsThe Chairman's Portrait looks out
As horses in gas masks speak bitterness
And fall upwards during earthquake drills
Struggle is in session
And struggle sessions 
Standing on stools 
Reading aloud their repentance
From blackboard cracked from being 
From the University of Heaven, Heaven, Heaven, HeavenEmbed
