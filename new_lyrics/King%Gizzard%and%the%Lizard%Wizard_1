Satanic Slumber Party Part 2 (Midnight in Sodom) LyricsIt's midnight in Sodom
The widows of Balam
The banshees, Pazuzu
The necro, the butcher
Lamia, Pandora
Barbatos, Gomorrah
Medusa, Drekavac
The wreakers of havoc
It's Friday night, my folks are out
Satanic Slumber Party's what I'm talking about
So if you're craving something graven or pagan, you've scored
Just bring your toothbrush and your Ouija board
I hear something
It's not nothing
I call FiFi but she's fucking ghosting me
I hear footsteps so I go outside to see
The lights flicker, lightning flashes in the sky
Spectre haunted, I try deep breathing exercises
Is it Satan or is it FiFi in disguise?
Hellhound goblin looking straight into my eyes
Is this romance, or am I, am I, am I, gonna fucking die?
Finally it's love
Finally it's love
Hello, hello, hello
It's midnight in Sodom
The widows of Balam
The banshees, Pazuzu
The necro, the butcher
Lamia, Pandora
Barbatos, Gomorrah
Medusa, Drekavac
The wreakers of havoc
It's Friday night, the power's out
Satanic Slumber Party's what I'm talking about
So say goodbye to heaven, say hello to hell
We eat our victims and we shit ourselves
As you're dreaming, I've been scheming
Summon Morta, control me with your sorcery
Rise Empusa, soak me in debauchery
Hemlock, mandrake, blood and sweat and blood-red eye
Snakeskin, cold blood, a sacrifice to crucify
My feet moving, although I try to back away
Your eye evil as you try to make me stay
Take all, I’m yours, you’re mine
Am I, am I, am I, am I Satan’s bride?
Finally it's love
Finally it's love
Finally it's love
Don't forget your jammies
It's gonna be pretty gnarly
Let's all learn karate
And kill your uncle Marty
