Work This Time Lyrics
I knock hello
But I see that you've got hypothermia
So I place a block to stop the rot
And hope that I can warm you up

Do I have to shake you, babe, until you're blind?
'Cause every light bulb's blown and I'm feeling so inclined

Can never lay my whole head down
Can never lay my whole head down
Can never lay my whole head down
I know I'm lazy but, baby, I will work this time
It's kind of funny
That I live the poetry I can not write
But you, my beauty
Shall be fixed forever loosely in my heart

Do I have to shake you, babe, until you're blind?
'Cause every light bulb's blown and I'm feeling so inclined

Can never lay my whole head down
Can never lay my whole head down
Can never lay my whole head down
I know I'm lazy but, baby, I will work this time13Embed
