Creepinâ€™ Up the Backstairs Lyrics
She said "I'm Rosie"
I said "I thought you were Lucy"
She said "No, Rosie, I told you so"
Was here with your sister
But she's going out the back
I want to dance and have fun, y'know
Of all the shitty little places I meet you, it's here
And I'm freaking out
I heard you got a brand new name
Selling Es in the dark
But hey, it's nothing to shout about

Don't just say yes to tease me
Do your utmost to please me
I don't mean to be sleazy
Being you can't be easy

When you're creepin' up the backstairs
Mother's nightmares
Falling in the front door, my my
Climbing in the window
Get dressed, let's go
Take your brother's car keys, bye bye
Well I see your yellow fingers
And your crucifix bones all covered in cellophane
Was there when your best friend said
"Sweetheart, I'm just here to get drunk again"
I wouldn't move if I was you
I wouldn't wanna get caught when the lights go out
She said "You think you're so special"
I said "Sunshine, I'm just bored. I'm just checking out"

Don't just say yes to tease me
Do your utmost to please me
I don't mean to be sleazy
Being you can't be easy

When you're creepin' up the backstairs
Mother's nightmares
Falling in the front door, my my
Climbing in the window
Get dressed, let's go
Take your brother's car keys, bye bye
Don't just say yes to tease me
Do your utmost to please me
I don't mean to be sleazy
Being you can't be easy
When you're creepin' up the backstairs
Mother's nightmares
Falling in the front door, my my
Climbing in the window
Get dressed let's go
Take your brother's car keys, bye bye
When you're creepin' up the backstairs
Mother's nightmares
Falling in the front door, my my
Climbing in the window
Get dressed let's go
Take your brother's car keys, bye byeEmbed
