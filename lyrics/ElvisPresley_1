Canâ€™t Help Falling in Love Lyrics
Wise men say only fools rush in
But I can't help falling in love with you

Shall I stay? Would it be a sin
If I can't help falling in love with you?

Like a river flows
Surely to the sea
Darling, so it goes
Some things are meant to be

Take my hand, take my whole life, too
For I can't help falling in love with you

Like a river flows
Surely to the sea
Darling, so it goes
Some things are meant to be

Take my hand, take my whole life, too
For I can't help falling in love with you
For I can't help falling in love with you110Embed
