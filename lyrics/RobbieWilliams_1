Party Like a Russian Lyrics
It takes a certain kind of man with a certain reputation
To alleviate the cash from a whole entire nation
Take my loose change and build my own space station
(Just because you can, man)
Ain't no refutin' or disputin' â€“ I'm a modern Rasputin
Subcontract disputes to some brutes in Louboutin
Act highfalutin' while my boys put the boots in
(They do the can-can)
(Spasibo)

Party like a Russian, end of discussion
Dance like you've got concussion, oh
Put a doll inside a doll
Party like a Russian, disco seduction
Party like a Russian, oh
Have it like an oligarch

I've got Stoli and Bolly and Molly, so I'm jolly
And I'm always off my trolley, so I never say sorry
There's a doll, inside a doll, inside a doll, inside a dolly
(Hello, Dolly)
I put a bank inside a car, inside a plane, inside a boat
It takes half the western world just to keep my ship afloat
And I never ever smile unless I've something to promote
I just won't emote
(Spasibo)
Party like a Russian, end of discussion
Dance like you've got concussion, oh
We've got soul and we've got gold
Party like a Russian, disco seduction
Party like a Russian, oh
Have it like an oligarch

Raz, dva, tri, chetyre
We're the Russian boys, we're everywhere
There's revolution in the air
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh

Party like a Russian, end of discussion
Dance like you've got concussion, oh
Put a doll inside a doll
Party like a Russian, disco seduction
Party like a Russian, oh
Have it like an oligarch8Embed
