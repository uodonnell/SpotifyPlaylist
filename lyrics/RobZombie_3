Well, Everybodyâ€™s Fucking in a U.F.O Lyrics
This is the story of the one-eyed wolf
Called the honey of super doom
She rode her five legged beast
In a mirrored bikini right out of the womb
They chased each other with the steam and knives
Screaming "oil is in my veins!"
And then she grabbed a big old pipe
And smoked up some fine old monkey brains

Get on it!

Now some say that one-eyed wolf
Owned midget who was almost ten feet tall
He spray-painted "UFO's are REAL"
In the rubble of the Berlin wall
So finally on that fateful day they went looking for a Superman
Singing "I'm gonna get my twenty bucks and vacation in Japan"

Look out!

Well everybody, everybody, everybody's fucking in a UFO
Well everybody, everybody, everybody's fucking in a UFO
Get up! x5
Now every night this wolf
Comes a peeping through through filthly glory holes
He's pounding on a rubber bat and a big old jelly roll
I said "look to the skies I think I saw a spaceship ready to feast"
But all they had was jizz on the walls
And bones of a mangled priest

Look out!

Now baby doll what do you say
When the spacemen comes to town
I think he's got a one-track mind
And he likes to boogie down
So in the end all that she did was murder metropolis
And show us big "fuck the world" carved right onto her chest

Look out!

Well everybody, everybody, everybody's fucking in a UFO
Well everybody, everybody, everybody's fucking in a UFO
Get up! x5Embed
