In a Drawer Lyrics
Sitting on a bearskin rug
Listening to grandpa talk
The whistle of an odd bird call
A photo of the long lost dog

Do you love me? Which one is it?
We should be living in a warehouse district
I take the day and the lesson it taught me
Passing off blame to anybody is easy
But darling, you know it shouldn't be like that
Can I go with you to the laundromat?

I found it in the drawer
In the drawer, I found it in a Drawer
Took a little time but now I found it a drawer
Can't go on, no I'll go on
Left it a long time ago
In a drawer, hidden in a drawer
I found it at the bottom, I found it in a drawer
Can't go on, no I'll go on
I found it in a drawer

Do you love me?
(Do you love me?)
The creaking wood under my walk
Familiar like an old time song
A memory when you were young
Remembering a time long gone

Do you love me, baby? Do you love me?
Do you love me, baby? Do you love me?

I found it in a drawer
In a drawer, I found it in a drawer
Took a little time but now I found it in a drawer
Can't go on, no I'll go on
Left it there a long time ago
In a drawer, hidden in a drawer
Found it at the bottom, I found it in a drawer
Can't go on, no I'll go on
I found it in a drawer
In a drawer, found it in a drawer
You have to go and now I found it in a drawer
Can't go on, no I'll go on1Embed
