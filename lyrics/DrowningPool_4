Sinner Lyrics
Bend me! Shape me! Misdirect me!
It's all the same to me
Look at all this useless talk
Look at all this useless talk
Look at all this useless talk upon the cross

You look at me, but you don't see
Understand, I'm a sinner
Don't corner me, don't lecture me
Raise your hands, you're a sinner

Is this everything you wanted!?
Find another dream
You never hear a word I say
You never hear a word I say
You never hear a word I say, so pray!

You look at me, but you don't see
Understand, I'm a sinner
Don't corner me, don't lecture me
Raise your hands, you're a sinner
I'm a sinner
Look at all these people in front of me
Look at all these people in front of me
Look at all these people in front of me
Look at all these people in front of me, now!

You look at me, but you don't see
Understand, I'm a sinner
Don't corner me, don't lecture me
Raise your hands, you're a sinner
You look at me (You look at me)
Don't corner me
You look at me (You look at me)
Raise your hands, you're a sinner!Embed
