We Come 1 LyricsAll the subtle flavours of my life have become
Bitter seeds and poisoned leaves without you
You represent what's true
I drain the colour from the sky and turn blue without you
These arms lack a purpose
Flappin' like a hummingbird, I'm nervous
'Cause I'm the left eye, you're the right
Would it not be madness to fight?
We come 1
In you the song which rights my wrongs
In you the fullness of living
The power to begin again
From right now in you
We come 1
(We come 1)
We come 1
We come
We come 1
I'm unafraid, never, never scared
Worries washed, pressed, aired
I am the left eye, you're the right
Would it not be madness to fight?
We come 1Embed
