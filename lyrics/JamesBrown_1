It’s a Man’s Man’s Man’s World Lyrics
This is a man's world
This is a man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing
Nothing without a woman or a girl

You see, man made the cars
To take us over the road
Man made the train
To carry the heavy load
Man made the electric light
To take us out of the dark
Man made the boat for the water
Like Noah made the ark

This is a man's, man's, man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing
Nothing without a woman or a girl

Man thinks about a little bit of baby girls
And a baby boys
Man make them happy
'Cause man make them toys
And after man make everything, everything he can
You know that man makes money
To buy from other man
This is a man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing
Not one little thing without a woman or a girl

He's lost in the wilderness
He's lost in bitterness
He's lost, lawd have mercy now, in loneliness14Embed
