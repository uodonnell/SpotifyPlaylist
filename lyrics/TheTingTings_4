Estranged Lyrics
I can't undo, I can't unsee
I can't unchoose, I can't unchange
I can't unpack, I can't unlose
I can't unfake you've caused no pain
What are we going to do, me and you?
I guess it's just different points of view
But I can't gain perspective
When you appear so unaffected

Estranged feels strange, estranged feels strange
This estranged feel strange, estranged feels strange
When there never was a fight, a wrong doing to blame
It's not the same as an argument
Estranged feels strange, estranged feels strange

Now I can't relate, I can't feel safe
I can't retain, I can't stay the same
I can't even say your name, I count the days
I cannot stand this bitter taste
So, what's the problem between us two?
'Cause I can't find perspective
When I still feel so connected to you
Estranged feels strange, estranged feels strange
Estranged feels strange, estranged feels strange
I wish we had a fight or reasons to hate
That always ends with an argument
Estranged feels strange, estranged feels strange


I can't undo, I can't unsee
I can't unchoose, I can't unchange
I can't unpack, I can't unlose
I can't unfake you've caused no pain
What are we going to do, me and you?
I guess it's just different points of view
But I can't gain perspective
When you appear so unaffected

(Estranged feels strange, estranged feels strange)
Estranged feels strange
(Estranged feels strange, estranged feels strange)
Estranged feels strange
Yeah, I wish we had a fight or reasons to hate
That always ends in an argument
(Estranged feels strange, estranged feels strange)
