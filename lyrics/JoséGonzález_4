Far Away Lyrics
Step in front of a runaway train
Just to feel alive again
Pushing forward through the night
Aching chest and blurry sight

It's so far, so far away
It's so far, so far away

Cold wind blows into the skin
Can't believe the state you're in...

It's so far, so far away
It's so far, so far away

Who are you trying to impress
Steadily creating a mess?
Step in front of a runaway train
Just to feel alive again
Pushing forward through the night
Aching chest and blurry sight
Aching chest and blurry sight
Aching chest and blurry sight

Step in front of a runaway train
Just to feel alive again
Pushing forward through the night
Aching chest and blurry sight
Aching chest and blurry sight
Aching chest and blurry sight...5Embed
