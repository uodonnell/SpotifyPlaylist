She Used To Call Me Dada LyricsA woman she loves me with all of her heart
Swear by many powers, we could never part
Since Ive left shes acting strange
Everything is changed, nothing remain the same
Call me, she used to call me bya
She used to call me, oh da
She working down, down town somewhere as a clerk
I know she had lots of potentials
Didnt have to prove no one or show her credentials
Used to call me, she used to call me
Used to call me dada
A woman she loves me with all her heart
Swear by some powers, we could never part
Since Ive left, acting strange
And everything is changed, nothing remain the same
Call me, she used to call me
She used to call me dada, yeah dada
Well, check out her home, found a work
Working down, down town somewhere, as a clerk
I know
Potential
But I heard, heard shes gone commercial
Used to call me, she used to call me
Call me, dada, dada, dada
She used to call me, she used to call me
She used to call me, dada, dada, dada2Embed
