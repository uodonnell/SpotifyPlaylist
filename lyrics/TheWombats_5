Letâ€™s Dance to Joy Division Lyrics
I'm back in Liverpool and everything seems the same
But I worked something out last night
That changed this little boy's brain
A small piece of advice that took twenty-two years in the make
And I will break it for you now; please learn from my mistakes
Please learn from my mistakes

Let's dance to Joy Division and celebrate the irony
Everything is going wrong, but we're so happy
Let's dance to Joy Division and raise our glass to the ceiling
'Cause this could all go so wrong, but we're so happy
Yeah, we're so happy...

So if you're ever feeling down, grab your purse and take a taxi
To the darker side of town; that's where we'll be
And we will wait for you and lead you through the dance floor
Up to the DJ booth, you know what to ask for
You know what to ask for...

Go ask for Joy Division and celebrate the irony
Everything is going wrong, but we're so happy
Let's dance to Joy Division and raise our glass to the ceiling
'Cause this could all go so wrong, but we're so happy
Yeah, we're so happy...

Let the love tear us apart; I've found the cure for a broken heart
Let it tear us apart
Let the love tear us apart; I've found the cure for a broken heart
Let it tear us apart (Let it tear us apart)
So let the love tear us apart; I've found the cure for a broken heart
Let it tear us apart (Let it tear us apart)
So let the love tear us apart; I've found the cure for a broken heart
Let it tear us apart, let it tear us apart
Let it tear us apart

Let's dance to Joy Division and celebrate the irony
Everything is going wrong, but we're so happy
Let's dance to Joy Division and raise our glass to the ceiling
'Cause this could all go so wrong, but we're so happy
Yeah, we're so happy

So happy, yeah, we're so happy
So happy, yeah, we're so happy6Embed
