Whoâ€™s Gonna Save My Soul Lyrics
I got some bad news, this morning
Which, in turn, made my day
When this someone spoke, I listened
All of a sudden has less, and less to say
Oh, how could this be?
All this time, I've lived vicariously

Who's gonna save my soul, now?
Who's gonna save my soul, now?
How will my story ever be told, now?
How will my story be told, now?

Made me feel like somebody
Hmm, like somebody else
Although he was imitated often
It felt like I was bein' myself
Is it a shame that someone else's song
Was totally and completely depended on?

Who's gonna save my soul, now?
Who's gonna save my soul, now?
I wonder if I'll live to grow old, now
Gettin' high 'cause I feel so low down
And maybe it's a little selfish
All I have is the memory
Yet, I never stopped to wonder
Was it possible you were hurtin' worse than me?
Still, my hunger turns to greed
'Cause what about what I need?
And oh

Who's gonna save my soul, now?
Who's gonna save my soul, now?
Oh, I know I'm out of control, now
Ooh, tired enough to lay my own soul down4Embed
