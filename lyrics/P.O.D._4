Booyaka 619 (Rey Mysterio) Lyrics
Booyaka, booyaka, 619
Booyaka, booyaka, that's my pueblo

Booyaka, booyaka, 619 (Hey!)
Booyaka, booyaka, that's my pueblo!
Booyaka, booyaka, 619 (Hey!)
Booyaka, booyaka, Rey Mysterio
Booyaka, booyaka, 619 (Hey!)
Booyaka, booyaka, that's my pueblo!
Booyaka, booyaka, 619 (Hey!)
What you gon' do when we come for you?

Ya llego el Rey Mysterio
El vato cabr칩n de San Diego
Flash up on the scene like a brown crusader
Blowing up screens like Space Invaders
Too much damage for one to manage
Going 5150 speaking Spanglish
Hazte a un lado estoy pesado
Vivo la vida peleando pecado
Alto, me duele la alma
Y deje mi cartera en Tijuana
El soldado enmascarado ten cuidado
Paisa paisa, estas pasado
Booyaka, booyaka, 619 (Hey!)
Booyaka, booyaka, that's my pueblo!
Booyaka, booyaka, 619 (Hey!)
Booyaka, booyaka, Rey Mysterio
Booyaka, booyaka, 619 (Hey!)
Booyaka, booyaka, that's my pueblo!
Booyaka, booyaka, 619 (Hey!)
What you gon' do when we come for you?

And we the Southtown generals, Diego Don originals
Hitman for hire, made wiseguys untouchable
Border bandits, running the streets and the canvas
We live and direct, no reruns, that's what's happening
Blow up the mannequin, better go ask your friends again
Terror in their eyes when they tell you "here comes the mask again"
No time for talkin, dig the whole for the coffin
It's no mystery Rey that he's a dead man walkin'
(El dia de los muertos) Say a prayer for the livin'
Ask God to take my soul in case I go unforgiven
(One shot) Two kills, you don't believe me now you will
And that's the realest deal homey since Jesus' last meal

Booyaka, booyaka, 619 (Hey!)
Booyaka, booyaka, that's my pueblo!
Booyaka, booyaka, 619 (Hey!)
Booyaka, booyaka, Rey Mysterio
Booyaka, booyaka, 619 (Hey!)
Booyaka, booyaka, that's my pueblo!
Booyaka, booyaka, 619 (Hey!)
What you gon' do when we come for you?
Mira, mira, watcha, watcha
Cuidado con los celos porque matan
Booyaka, booyaka, el reguet칩n
Me moda no Mysterio, est치 cabron
One, two, three, 619 down with P.O.D
Como la ves
F치cil como uno, dos, tres
Mr. DJ, play that rola otra vez
And watch how many people go off
Under the wooden cross, who's the boss
Nadie brinca
'Ta el cielo con mi vos guio el ciego
La voz inocente de mi gente
Truena fuerte como cohete
That's just life in the 619
So hey, DJ, hit me one more time

Booyaka, booyaka, 619 (Hey!)
Booyaka, booyaka, that's my pueblo!
Booyaka, booyaka, 619 (Hey!)
Booyaka, booyaka, Rey Mysterio
Booyaka, booyaka, 619 (Hey!)
Booyaka, booyaka, that's my pueblo!
Booyaka, booyaka, 619 (Hey!)
What you gon' do when we come for you?Embed
