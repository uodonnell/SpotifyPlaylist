Shiver Lyrics
I walk a mile with a smile
I don't know I don't care where I am
But I know it's all right
Jump the tracks, can't get back
I don't know anyone round here
But I'm safe this time

Cause when you tell me, tell me, tell me
Stupid things like you do
Yes I have to, have to, have to
Change the rules; I can't lose

Cause I shiver, I just break up
When I'm near you it all gets out of hand
Yes I shiver, I get bent up
There's no way back
I know you'll understand

We talk and talk, round it all
Who'd have thought we'd end up here?
But I'm feeling fine
In a rush never trust, you'll be there
If I'd only stop and take my time
Cause with you I'm running, running, running
Somewhere I can't get to
Yes I have to, have to, have to
Change the rules; I'm with you

Cause I shiver, I just break up
When I'm near you it all gets out of hand
Yes I shiver, I get bent up
There's no way back
I know you'll understand

What if you get off at the next stop?
Would you just wave as I'm drifting off?
And if I never saw you again
Could I (could I) keep all (all of) of this (of this) inside?

Cause I shiver, I just break up
When I'm near you it all gets out of hand
Yes I shiver, I get bent up
There's no way back
I know you'll understand
I shiver I shiver

Yes I shiver, I just break up
When I'm near you it all gets out of hand
Yes I shiver, I get bent up
There's no way back
I know you'll understandEmbed
