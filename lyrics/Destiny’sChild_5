Independent Women - Part 1 Lyrics
Lucy Liu
With my girl Drew
Cameron D. and Destiny
Charlie's Angels, come on
Uh, uh, uh

Question, tell me what you think about me
I buy my own diamonds and I buy my own rings
Only ring your celly when I'm feelin' lonely
When it's all over, please get up and leave
Question, tell me how you feel about this
Try to control me, boy, you get dismissed
Pay my own car note and I pay my own bills
Always fifty-fifty in relationships

The shoes on my feet, I bought 'em
The clothes I'm wearing, I bought 'em
The rock I'm rocking, I bought it
'Cause I depend on me if I want it
The watch I'm wearing, I bought it
The house I live in, I bought it
The car I'm driving, I bought it
I depend on me (I depend on me)
All the women who independent
Throw your hands up at me
All the honeys who making money
Throw your hands up at me
All the mamas who profit dollars
Throw your hands up at me
All the ladies who truly feel me
Throw your hands up at me

Girl, I didn't know you could get down like that
Charlie, how your Angels get down like that?
Girl, I didn't know you could get down like that
Charlie, how your Angels get down like that?

Tell me how you feel about this
Do what I want, live how I wanna live
I worked hard and sacrificed to get what I get
Ladies, it ain't easy being independent
Question, how'd you like this knowledge that I brought?
Braggin' on that cash that he gave you is a front
If you're gonna brag, make sure it's your money you flaunt
Depend on no one else to give you what you want
The shoes on my feet, I bought 'em
The clothes I'm wearing, I bought 'em
The rock I'm rocking, I bought it
'Cause I depend on me if I want it
The watch I'm wearing, I bought it
The house I live in, I bought it
The car I'm driving, I bought it
I depend on me (I depend on me)

All the women who independent (Hey)
Throw your hands up at me (Ho)
All the honeys who making money
Throw your hands up at me (Up at me, baby)
All the mamas who profit dollars
Throw your hands up at me
All the ladies who truly feel me
Throw your hands up at me

Girl, I didn't know you could get down like that
Charlie, how your Angels get down like that?
Girl, I didn't know you could get down like that
Charlie, how your Angels get down like that?
Destiny's Child, what's up?
You in the house? Sure 'nuff
Well, break these people off, Angel style
Child of Destiny (Whoa)
Independent beauty (Whoa-oh)
No one else takes care me (Oh-oh)
Charlie's Angels (Oh-whoa-oh)

All the women who are independent
Throw your hands up at me
All the honeys who making money
Throw your hands up at me
All the mamas who profit dollars
Throw your hands up at me
All the ladies who truly feel me
Throw your hands up at me

Girl, I didn't know you could get down like that
Charlie, how your Angels get down like that?
Girl, I didn't know you could get down like that
Charlie, how your Angels get down like that?
Girl, I didn't know you could get down like that
Charlie, how your Angels get down like that?
Girl, I didn't know you could get down like that
Charlie, how your Angels get down like that?17Embed
