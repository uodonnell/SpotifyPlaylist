Tired Lyrics
I'm alive in here, so alive in here
Pulling down a little peace
I'm open wide in here, slow to rise in here
Saving grace and killing me
You say this only makes me incomplete
I'm canceled out and rendered obsolete
Tell the mad chameleon he's not welcome anymore
I know what I'm looking for...

Somewhere close, somewhere safe
Somewhere I know—I know I'll never live in chains
The one is now aware
So stay away from me—I'm just too young to care

I can see in here; I can feel in here
Comatose with common sense
I take my time in here; somebody get me out of here
What am I so against?
I just want to watch the whole world burn
Lost a million times and I won't learn
Show me someone innocent, I'll show you there's no proof
I may be gone, but I'm no fool...
I'm not close; I'm not safe
I don't know—don't know—am I better off in chains?
The one is not aware
So stay away from me—I'm just too young to care

I need somewhere close, somewhere safe
Somewhere I know—I know I'll never live in chains
The one is now aware
So stay away from me—I'm just too young to care
Too young to care3Embed
