Hands Lyrics
(I don't wanna go out
I wanna stay in)

Two hands
I wanna play the piano with two hands
Shoulda learned
To ask for many it's the way of the world
Boy you wanna be good to me
You gave me a piano with all 88 keys
But two hands
What's a girl to do with two hands
To make the money like the richest of man
What's a guy to do with two hands

I can make you be so good to me
You give me all the time with my sexuality

So clap your hands if you're working too hard
Clap your hands if you're working too hard
Clap your hands if you're working too hard
Clap your hands if you're working too hard
And the beat's so hard, you're workin', workin'
Two hands
What you're supposed to do with two hands?
To get the life of the richest of man
Where you supposed to go with two hands?
I can not but something in between
When I'm breaking my back and I'm on my knees

So clap your hands if you're working too hard
Clap your hands if you're working too hard
Clap your hands if you're working too hard
Clap your hands if you're working too hard
And the beat's so hard, you're workin', workin'

And I can't escape from the work in L.A
And I can't sleep in my bed in U.K
When you clap your hands if you're working too hard
Clap your hands if you're working too hard

You see life and it's falling away-ay-ay
You slow down and the rest makes you pay-ay-ay
I see you lookin' it up
You want to think about it
Clap your hands if you're working too hard
Clap your hands if you're working too hard
Clap your hands if you're working too hard
And the beat's so hard, you're workin' workin'

And I can't escape from the work in LA
And I can't sleep in my bed in U.K
When you clap your hands if you're working too hard
Clap your hands if you're working too hardEmbed
