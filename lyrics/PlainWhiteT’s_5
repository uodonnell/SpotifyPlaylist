Your Body Lyrics
My favorite pastime is
Getting lost beneath your eyelids
I can't stop staring at you
And lately, my heartbeat's been studying your body
Now I know just what to do

I don't know nobody
Like I know your body
Every shape, every curve
Every twist and every turn
I don't want nobody
If it ain't your body
I'll keep you forever satisfied, you'll see
'Cause nobody knows your body like me

Each freckle, I outline
I'll keep on taking my time
Kissing the space in between (kissing the space in between)
Spend all day admiring
Your dimples when you're smiling
So keep on smiling at me

I don't know nobody
Like I know your body
Every shape, every curve
Every twist and every turn
I don't want nobody
If it ain't your body
I'll keep you forever satisfied, you'll see
'Cause nobody knows your body like me

I'll ace any pop quiz, baby, with my eyes closed
'Cause I know every inch from your head to your toes

I don't know nobody
Like I know your body
Every shape, every curve
Every twist and every turn
I don't want nobody
If it ain't your body
I'll keep you forever satisfied, you'll see (oh oh oh oh)
'Cause nobody knows your body like
Nobody knows your body like
Nobody knows your body like meEmbed
