Third of May / Ōdaigahara LyricsThird of May
Light ended the night, but the song remained
And I was hiding by the stair, half here
Half there, past the lashing rain
And as the sky would petal white, old innocent lies came to mind
As we stood, congregated, at the firing line
Night ended the fight, but the song remained
And so I headed to the wall
Turned tail to call to the new domain
As if in the sight of sea, you're suddenly free
But it's all the same...
Oh, but I can hear you, loud in the center
Aren't we made to be crowded together, like leaves?

Was I too slow? Did you change overnight?
Second son, on the other line...

Now, back in our town as a castaway
I'm reminded of the time it all fell in line, on the third of May
As if it were designed, painted in sand to be washed away
Oh, but I can hear you, loud in the center
Aren't we made to be crowded together, like leaves?
Was I too slow? Did I change overnight?
Second son, for the second time...
Can I be light and free?
If I lead you through the fury will you call to me?
And is all that I might owe you carved on ivory?
But all will fade. All I say. All I needed
As a flash in the eye, I wouldn't deny, all receded

Life unfolds in pools of gold
I am only owed this shape if I make a line to hold
To be held within one's self is deathlike, oh I know

But all will be, for mine and me, as we make it
And the size of the fray, can't take it away, they won't make it

I was a fool
Crime after crime to confess to
But I hold the fleet angel, she'll bless you
Hold fast to the wing. Hold fast to the wing
