Hard Out Here Lyrics
I suppose I should tell you what this bitch is thinking
You'll find me in the studio and not in the kitchen
I won't be bragging 'bout my cars or talking 'bout my chains
Don't need to shake my ass for you 'cause I've got a brain
If I told you 'bout my sex life, you'd call me a slut
When boys be talking 'bout their bitches, no one's making a fuss
There's a glass ceiling to break, uh-huh, there's money to make
And now it's time to speed it up 'cause I can't move at this pace

Sometimes, it's hard to find the words to say
I'll go ahead and say them anyway
Forget your balls and grow a pair of tits
It's hard, it's hard
It's hard out here for a bitch

It's hard for a bitch (For a bitch)
For a bitch, it's hard
It's hard out here for a bitch
It's hard for a bitch (For a bitch)
For a bitch, it's hard
It's hard out here

If you're not a size six, then you're not good-looking
Well, you better be rich or be real good at cooking
You should probably lose some weight
'Cause we can't see your bones
You should probably fix your face or you'll end up on your own
Don't you want to have somebody who objectifies you?
Have you thought about your butt; who's gonna tear it in two?
We've never had it so good, uh-huh
We're out of the woods
And if you can't detect the sarcasm, you've misunderstood
Sometimes, it's hard to find the words to say
I'll go ahead and say them anyway
Forget your balls and grow a pair of tits
It's hard, it's hard
It's hard out here for a bitch

It's hard for a bitch (For a bitch)
For a bitch, it's hard
It's hard out here for a bitch
It's hard for a bitch  (For a bitch)
For a bitch, it's hard
It's hard out here

A bitch, a bitch, a bitch
Bitch, bitch (bitch)
A bitch, a bitch, a bitch
Bitch, bitch
A bitch, a bitch, a bitch
Bitch, bitch
A bitch, a bitch, a bitch
Bitch, bitch

Inequality promises that it's here to stay
Always trust the injustice 'cause it's not going away
Inequality promises that it's here to stay
Always trust the injustice, 'cause it's not going away
Sometimes, it's hard to find the words to say
I'll go ahead and say them anyway
Forget your balls and grow a pair of tits
It's hard, it's hard
It's hard out here for a bitch

It's hard for a bitch (For a bitch)
For a bitch, it's hard
It's hard out here for a bitch
It's hard for a bitch (For a bitch)
For a bitch, it's hard
It's hard out here
It's hard for a bitch (For a bitch)
For a bitch, it's hard
It's hard out here for a bitch
It's hard for a bitch (For a bitch)
For a bitch, it's hard
It's hard out here
