The Deconstruction Lyrics
The deconstruction has begun
Time for me to fall apart
And if you think that it was rough
I tell you nothing changes
Till you start to break it down

And break apart
I'll break apart
I'll break apart
Right now it's going to start
I'll break apart

The reconstruction will begin
Only when there's nothing left
But little pieces on the floor
They're made of what I was
Before I had to break it down

And break apart
I'll break apart
I'll break apart
Right now it's going to start
I'll break apart
And every block you've built on
It's going to come right out

And break apart
I'll break apart
I'll break apart
Right now it's going to start
I'll break apart
Right now it's going to start
I'll break apart

I'll break apart
I'll break apart1Embed
