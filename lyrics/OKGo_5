Obsession Lyrics
A look so quick, a movement so slight
You could almost imagine it didn’t just happen
But everything will change, in just one look, one little glance
It’s not passing fascination now

It’s obsession, uh-huh
It’s obsession
It’s obsession, uh-huh
It’s obsession
It’s obsession


And it’s physical, it’s like standing at the edge:
Your blood starts to pump, ‘cause you’re worried you might jump
And your head throbbing like a heart
And your heart throbbing like a drum
And the drums throbbing like the point is just go ahead and jump

It’s obsession, uh-huh
It’s obsession
It’s obsession, uh-huh
It’s obsession
It’s obsession

There's only one way out
There's only one way out
There's only one way out
There's only one way out


A look so quick, a movement so slight
Oh, it’s not passing fascination now

It’s obsession, uh-huh
It’s obsession
It’s obsession, uh-huh
It’s obsession
