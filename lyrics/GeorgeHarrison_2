Isnâ€™t It a Pity Lyrics
Isn't it a pity?
Now isn't it a shame?
How we break each other's hearts and cause each other pain
How we take each other's love without thinking anymore
Forgetting to give back
Isn't it a pity?

Some things take so long, but how do I explain
When not too many people can see we're all the same
And because of all their tears
Their eyes can't hope to see the beauty that surrounds them
Isn't it a pity?

Isn't it a pity?
Isn't it a shame?
How we break each other's hearts and cause each other pain
How we take each other's love without thinking anymore
Forgetting to give back
Isn't it a pity?

Forgetting to give back
Isn't it a pity?
Forgetting to give back
Now, isn't it a pity?
