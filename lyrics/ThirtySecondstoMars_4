Dangerous Night Lyrics
We burned and we bled, we try to forget
But the memories left are still haunting
The walls that we built from bottles and pills
We swallow until we're not talking

I, I am a man on fire
You, a violent desire

What a dangerous night to fall in lo-o-ove
Don't know why we still hide what we've beco-o-ome (Oh, oh)
Do you wanna cross the line?
We're runnin' out of time
A dangerous night to fall in lo-o-ove

Started a stranger, a lover in danger
The edge of a knife
The face of an angel, the heart of a ghost
Was it a dream?

I, I am a man on fire
You, a violent desire
What a dangerous night to fall in lo-o-ove
Don't know why we still hide what we've beco-o-ome (Oh, oh)
Do you wanna cross the line?
We're runnin' out of time
A dangerous night to fall in lo-o-ove (Oh, oh)

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

I, I am a man on fire
Fire, fire, fire, fire
You, a violent desire

A dangerous night to fall in lo-o-ove
A dangerous night to fall in lo-o-ove
Do you wanna cross the line?
We're runnin' out of time
A dangerous night to fall in lo-o-ove (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
A dangerous night to fall in lo-o-ove (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
A dangerous night to fall in lo-o-ove (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)7Embed
