Sorry for Party Rocking Lyrics
Sorry for party rocking

Yo, I be up in a party looking for a hottie to bone
I got a drink in my hand and they just called buffalo (Buffalo!)
Poppin' bottles in the house with the models in the V.I.P
All the girls make out for the whole damn club to see

Let's go
People always say that my music's loud
Sorry for party rocking
Neighbors complain saying, "Turn it down!"
Sorry for party rocking
Haters don't like we got the spotlight
Sorry for party rocking
When they talk shit, we just be like
Sorry for party rocking

Baby, baby, baby, I'm awfully crazy
Off Ciroc, off Patron, shit whatever's tasty!
We don't got no manners hanging off the rafters
Let's go drink for drink, a hundred bucks she won't out last us
Check my style, take a good look, I'm fresh, bitch
In my whip with music so loud I'm deaf, bitch
Getting brain at a red light with people watching
Sorry for party rocking
If you show up already toe up, this is what you say
Sorry for party rocking
And if you're blacked out with your sack out, this is what you say
Sorry for party rocking
And if you throw up in your hoe's cup, this is what you say
Sorry for party rocking
And if she has a hissy fit cause you're whiskey dick, this is what you say
Sorry for party rocking
Oh!

I don't give a fuck when I'm in the club
Sipping bub, really drunk, and I see a fat booty
Gotta have it, I'm a grab it, it's a habit, automatic like Uzi
Uzi with the sick flow
Make a chick go crazy and flash them ta-ta's
Redfoo, the dude, a true party rocker

I'm true to the game too
It's called beer pong and I can't lose
I got a bunch of bad bitches in the back
With Ciroc on tap and a little bit of Grey Goose, ooh
Oh yeah we killin shit
With our money we diligent
So here's a sorry in advance
No hard feelings bitch
Sorry for party rocking
People always say that my music's loud
Sorry for party rocking
Neighbors complain saying, "Turn it down!"
Sorry for party rocking
Haters don't like we got the spotlight
Sorry for party rocking
When they talk shit, we just be like
