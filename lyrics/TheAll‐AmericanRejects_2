Gives You Hell Lyrics
I wake up every evening
With a big smile on my face
And it never feels out of place
And you're still probably working
At a nine to five pace
I wonder how bad that tastes

When you see my face, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell

Now where's your picket fence, love?
And where's that shiny car?
And did it ever get you far?
You never seemed so tense, love
I've never seen you fall so hard
Do you know where you are?

And truth be told, I miss you
And truth be told, I'm lying

When you see my face, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
If you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
Then he's a fool, you're just as well, hope it gives you hell
I hope it gives you hell
Tomorrow, you'll be thinking to yourself
"Yeah, where did it all go wrong?"
But the list goes on and on

And truth be told, I miss you
And truth be told, I'm lying

When you see my face, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
When you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
Then he's a fool, you're just as well, hope it gives you hell

Now, you'll never see what you've done to me
You can take back your memories, they're no good to me
And here's all your lies, you can look me in the eyes
With the sad, sad look that you wear so well
When you see my face, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
When you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
Then he's a fool, you're just as well, hope it gives you hell
When you see my face, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell (Hope it gives you hell!)
When you walk my way, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell (Hope it gives you hell)
When you hear this song and you sing along, no you never tell (No you never tell)
Then you're the fool, I'm just as well, hope it gives you hell (Hope it gives you hell)

When you hear this song, I hope that it will give you hell
(Give you hell)
You can sing along, I hope that it puts you through hell49Embed
