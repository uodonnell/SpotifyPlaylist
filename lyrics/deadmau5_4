Drama Free Lyrics
Think of a monster, you name it, I been it
It's been a hell of a ride, but I’m in it
Birth of a queen is the death of a cynic
I'ma be good, but just give me a minute
Nowhere to go when I'm back at the wheel
No one but me gives a **** how I feel
So I’m gonna drive 'til I find a good meal
And maybe then we'll talk for real

I'm on the road to heaven knows where
And I'm feeling okay, yeah, I'm feeling okay
More, more, more, more, more, more, more
More, more, more, more, more, more, more

Tie your hair back, keep the car running
Pack the Hanzo, don't stop for nothing
Go ahead and get what you need
Gotta keep it drama free
Don't forget you ain’t owned by nobody
Shut the door when you count your money
Gotta keep it drama free
Gotta keep it drama free
I’m on the road to heaven knows where
I'm feeling okay, yeah, I’m feeling okay
I'm up for air with the wind in my hair
Nothing is bringing me down
Nothing is bringing me down no more
More, more, more, more, more, more
More, more, more, more, more, more, more

Think of a monster, you name it, I been it
It's been a hell of a ride, but I'm in it
Birth of a queen is the death of a cynic
I’ma be good, but just give me a minute
Nowhere to go when I'm back at the wheel
No one but me gives a **** how I feel
So I'm gonna drive 'til I find a good meal
And maybe then we'll talk for real

I'm on the road to heaven knows where
And I'm feeling okay, yeah, I'm feeling okay
I'm up for air with the wind in my hair
Nothing is bringing me down
Nothing is bringing me down no more
More, more, more, more, more, more
More, more, more, more, more, more, more
Tie your hair back, keep the car running
Pack the Hanzo, don't stop for nothing
Go ahead and get what you need
Gotta keep it drama free
Don't forget you ain't owned by nobody
Shut the door when you count your money
Gotta keep it drama free
Gotta keep it drama free5Embed
