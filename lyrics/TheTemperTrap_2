Fall Together Lyrics
You and me know we're meant to be
Maybe we'll never know
You and me are worst enemies
Cause we don't believe anymore

Out on the streets
Our colors bleed
Nobody speaks to me

Here I am, give me something I could follow
So I can find my way out from the shadows
Raise your voice cause the time is now or never
And if we have to fall, we'll fall together

Shallow dreams tell me everything
I've been listening, but all I hear's you
Pulling strings
And you'll do anything to keep me hanging on your every word

Out on the streets
Our colors bleed
Are you the one to speak to me?
Here I am, give me something I could follow
So I can find my way out from the shadows
Raise your voice cause the time is now or never
And if we have to fall, we'll fall together

Thunderstorm, closing in
We're miles off coast from where we're headed
To break our fall
It's the final call
It's the final call
It's now or never

Here I am, give me something I could follow
So I can find my way out from the shadows
Raise your voice cause the time is now or never
And if we have to fall, we'll fall together
Here I am, give me something I could follow
So I can find my way out from the shadows
Raise your voice cause the time is now or never
And if we have to fall, we'll fall together2Embed
