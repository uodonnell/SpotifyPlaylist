The Shade Lyrics
I'm following the sun
That's setting in the West
We're floating on a bed of fading lights
A canopy of trees
Bears witness to the breeze
I'm falling like a feather, soft and light

Baby, there's no better time
No better time, baby, we can't find
Oh-whoa-whoa, oh-whoa-whoa

With eternal love, the stars above
All there is and ever was
I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, I want it all
A blade of grass, a grain of sand
The moonlit sea, to hold your hand
I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, I want it all

The embers of a fire still burning as they die
Stay bright to keep us side by side
Baby, there's no better time
No better time, baby, we can't find
Oh-whoa-whoa, oh-whoa-whoa

With eternal love, the stars above
All there is and ever was
I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, I want it all
A blade of grass, a grain of sand
The moonlit sea, to hold your hand
I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, I want it all
With eternal love, the stars above
All there is and ever was
I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, I want it all
A blade of grass, a grain of sand
The moonlit sea, to hold your hand
I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, I want it all

We got the sunshine
We got the shade
We got temptation
We got it made
We got rewarded
We got refused
We got distorted
We got confused
We got the sunshine
We got the shade
I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, I want it all
With eternal love, the stars above
All there is and ever was
I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, I want it all
A blade of grass, a grain of sand
The moonlit sea, to hold your hand
I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, I want it all
With eternal love, the stars above
All there is and ever was
I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, I want it all
A blade of grass, a grain of sand
The moonlit sea, to hold your hand
I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, I want it all7Embed
