She Donâ€™t Use Jelly Lyrics
I know a girl who thinks of ghosts
She'll make you breakfast
She'll make you toast
But she don't use butter
And she don't use cheese
She don't use jelly
Or any of these
She uses Vaseline
Vaseline
Vaseline

And I know a guy who goes to shows
When he's at home and he blows his nose
He don't use tissues or his sleeve
He don't use napkins or any of these
He uses magazines
Magazines
Magazines
Magazines

I know a girl who reminds me of Cher
(Reminds me of Cher)
She's always changing
(She's always changing)
The color of her hair
(Color of her hair)
But she don't use nothing
That you buy at the store
She likes her hair to be real orange
She uses tangerines
Tangerines
Tangerines
Tangerines
Tangerines
Tangerines
