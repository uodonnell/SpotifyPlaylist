Ocean Lyrics
I've lost the will to
I've lost my way
I've lost this ocean
I poisoned me

People collector
People collector
I'm on the move
For you

Oh, and I
Wouldn't lie
Wanna be your...

I borrowed bones, I borrowed skin
To save me from the hell I'm in
Your fantasy
And every time I think of you
I see the dark, I hear their hooves
They're coming
They're coming for you
I've lost the will to
I've lost my way
I've lost this ocean
I poisoned me

People collector
People collector
I'm on the move
For you

Oh, and I
Wouldn't lie
Wanna be your...

I borrowed bones, I borrowed skin
To save me from the hell I'm in
Your fantasy
And every time I think of you
I see the dark, I hear their hooves
They're coming
They're coming for you7Embed
