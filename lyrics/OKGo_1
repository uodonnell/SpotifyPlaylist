The Writing’s on the Wall Lyrics
Listen, I know it's been hard
You know it’s no different for me
We’re less than a zero-sum game now
And baby, we both know that's not how it's supposed to be

The writing's on the wall
It seems like forever since we had a good day
The writing’s on the wall

But I... just wanna get you high tonight
I... just wanna see some pleasure in your eyes
Some pleasure in your eyes

I go too high, and you go too cold
And we both fall apart
Then you bring your mind to rest against mine
But the mind has no say in affairs of the heart

The writing's on the wall
It seems like forever since we had a good day
The writing’s on the wall
But I... just wanna get you high tonight
I... just wanna see some pleasure in your eyes
Some pleasure in your eyes

Then you bring your mind to rest against mine
But the mind has no say in affairs of the heart

The writing's on the wall
It seems like forever since we had a good day
The writing’s on the wall

But I... just wanna get you high tonight
I... just wanna see some pleasure in your eyes
Some pleasure in your eyes

Just wanna get you high, high, high
Just wanna get you high
I just wanna get you high
Even if it's the last thing that we do together
Even if it's the last thing that we do together5Embed
