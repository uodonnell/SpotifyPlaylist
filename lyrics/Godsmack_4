I Stand Alone Lyrics
I've told you this once before, you can't control me
If you try to take me down, you're gonna break
I feel your every nothing that you're doing for me
I'm thinking you ought to make your own way

I stand alone, inside
I stand alone

You're always hiding behind your so-called goddess
So, what? You don't think that we can see your face?
Resurrected back before the final falling
I'll never rest until I can make my own way
I'm not afraid of fading

I stand alone
Feeling your sting down inside me, I'm not dying for it
I stand alone
Everything that I believe is fading
I stand alone, inside
I stand alone

And now, it's my time (Now it's my time)
It's my time to dream (It's my time to dream)
Dream of the skies (Dream of the skies)
Make me believe that this place isn't plagued by the poison in me
Help me decide if my fire will burn out before you can breathe
Breathe into me
I stand alone inside
I stand alone
I stand alone
Feeling your sting down inside me, I'm not dying for it
I stand alone
Everything that I believe is fading
I stand alone inside
I stand alone inside
I stand alone inside
I stand alone inside6Embed
