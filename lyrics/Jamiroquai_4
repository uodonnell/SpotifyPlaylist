Seven Days in Sunny June Lyrics
The pebbles you've arranged
In the sand, they're strange
They speak to me like constellations
As we lie here
There's a magic I can hold
Your smile of honey gold
And that you never seem to be in short supply of

Foood, so baby let's get it on
Drinking wine and killing time
Sitting in the summer sun
You know I've wanted you so long
Why do you have to
Drop that bomb on me?

Lazy days, crazy dolls
You said we've been friends too long

Seven days in sunny June
Were long enough to bloom
The flowers on the summer dress you wore in spring
The way we laughed as one
And then you dropped the bomb
That I've known you too long
For us to have a thing
Oooh, so baby let's get it on
Drinking wine and killing time
Sitting in the summer sun
You know I've wanted you so long
Why do you have to
Drop that bomb on me?
Oooh, so baby let's get it on
Drinking wine and killing time
Sitting in the summer sun
You know I've wanted you so long
Why do you have to
Drop that bomb on me?

Could it be this?
The stories in your eyes
The silent wings
You'll fly away on

Seven days in sunny June
Were long enough to bloom
The flowers on the sunbeam dress you wore in spring
Yeah, yeah, the way we laughed as one
Why did you drop the bomb on me?
Oooh, so baby let's get it on
Drinking wine and killing time
Sitting in the summer sun
You know I've wanted you so long
Why do you have to
Drop that bomb on me?

Could it be this?
The honeysuckle blessings you seem to show me
Could it be this?
For seven days in June I wasn't lonely
Could it be this?
You never gave me time to say I love you
Could it be this?
I know you don't believe me but it's so true

Don't walk away from me, girl
I read the stories in your eyes
Don't you walk away from me
I read the stories in your eyes

And you've been telling me
We've been friends for too long, yeah
I think I love you
I think I love you
Why do you want to drop that bomb?2Embed
