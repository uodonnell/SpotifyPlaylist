High and Low Lyrics
Now we are running in a pack to the place you don't know
And I want you to know that I'll always be around
Down where the summer and the late nights last forever
There's a house on the hill and we can't travel now

Alice D, you’re on your way up
Way up
Way up

I feel both sides, babe, high and low (high and low)
If I had my way, never let you go (never let you go)
I feel both sides, babe,  high and low (high and low)
If I had my way, never let you go (never let you go)

Let's get together and forget all the troubles and just float
I don't want you to go
I need to be closer to now

Alice D, you’re on your way up
Way up
Way up
I feel both sides, babe,  high and low (high and low)
If I had my way, never let you go (never let you go)
I feel both sides, babe, high and low (high and low)
If I had my way, never let you go (never let you go)

Alice D is on her way home
She's been out all night again
She don't want nobody's help now
She sees stars and rocket ships

I feel both sides, babe, high and low (high and low)
If I had my way, never let you go (never let you go)
I feel both sides, babe, high and low (high and low)
If I had my way, never let you go (never let you go)
I feel both sides, babe, high and low (high and low)
If I had my way, never let you go (never let you go)
I feel both sides, babe, high and low (high and low)
If I had my way, never let you go (never let you go)3Embed
