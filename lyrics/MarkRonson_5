Valerie (Version Revisited) Lyrics
Well, sometimes, I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things, what you're doin'
And in my head, I paint a picture

'Cause since I've come home
Well, my body's been a mess
And I miss your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over?
Stop makin' a fool, out of me
Why don't you come on over, Valerie

Valerie
Valerie
Valerie

Did you have to go to jail?
Put your house on up for sale?
Did you get a good lawyer?
Hope you didn't catch a ten
Hope you found the right man who'll fix it for ya
Are you shoppin' anywhere?
Change the colour of your hair?
Are you busy?
And did you have to pay that fine
You was dodging all the time?
Are you still busy?
'Cause since I've come home
Well, my body's been a mess
And I miss your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over?
Stop makin' a fool, out of me
Why don't you come on over Valerie

Valerie
Valerie
Valerie

Well, sometimes, I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things, what you're doin'
And in my head, I paint a picture

'Cause since I've come home
Well, my body's been a mess
And I miss your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over?
Stop makin' a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over, Valerie
Valerie
Valerie
Valerie

Oh, Valerie
Valerie
Valerie
Valerie
Why don't you come on over, Valerie3Embed
