Fire Water Burn Lyrics
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
We don't need no water, let the motherfucker burn
Burn, motherfucker, burn

Hello, my name is Jimmy Pop and I'm a dumb white guy
I'm not old or new, but middle school, fifth grade, like junior high
I don't know mofo', if y'all peeps be bugging, givin' props to my ho, 'cause she fly
But I can take the heat, 'cause I'm the other white meat known as 'Kid Funky Fried'
Yeah, I'm hung like planet Pluto, hard to see with the naked eye
But if I crashed into Uranus, I would stick it where the sun don't
Shine
'Cause I'm kind of like Han Solo, always stroking my own Wookiee
I'm the root of all that's evil, yeah, but you can call me Cookie
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
We don't need no water, let the motherfucker burn
Burn, motherfucker, burn

Yo, yo, this hardcore ghetto gangster image takes a lot of practice
I'm not black, like Barry White, no, I am white, like Frank Black is
So, if man is five and the devil is six, then that must make me seven
This honkey's gone to Heaven
But if I go to hell, well then, I hope I burn well
I'll spend my days with JFK, Marvin Gaye, Martha Raye, and Lawrence Welk
And Kurt Cobain, Kojak, Mark Twain and Jimi Hendrix's poltergeist
And Webster, yeah, Emmanuel Lewis, 'cause he's the Antichrist
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
We don't need no water, let the motherfucker burn
Burn, motherfucker, burn
