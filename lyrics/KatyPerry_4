Bon Appétit Lyrics
Ayy, yeah
Katy Perry, Migos
Ayy!

'Cause I'm all that you want, boy
All that you can have, boy
Got me spread like a buffet
Bon a, bon appétit, baby
Appetite for seduction
Fresh out the oven
Melt in your mouth kind of lovin'
Bon a, bon appétit, baby (Woo)

Looks like you've been starving
You've got those hungry eyes (Woo)
You could use some sugar
'Cause your levels ain't right (Woo)
I'm a five-star Michelin
A Kobe flown in (Woo)
You want what I'm cooking, boy

Let me take you (Woo)
Under candlelight
We can wine and dine
A table for two
And it's okay (Woo)
If you take your time
Eat with your hands, fine
I'm on the menu
'Cause I'm all that you want, boy
All that you can have, boy
Got me spread like a buffet
Bon a, bon appétit, baby
Appetite for seduction
Fresh out the oven
Melt in your mouth kind of lovin'
Bon a, bon appétit, baby (Woo)

So you want some more
Well I'm open 24 (Woo)
Wanna keep you satisfied
Customer's always right (Woo)
Hope you've got some room
For the world's best cherry pie (Woo)
Gonna hit that sweet tooth, (Ayy) boy

Let me take you (Woo)
Under candlelight
We can wine and dine
A table for two
And it's okay (Woo)
If you take your time (Ayy)
Eat with your hands, fine (Yeah)
I'm on the menu
Go ahead
'Cause I'm all that you want, boy (All that you want)
All that you can have, boy (Ayy)
Got me spread like a buffet
Bon a, bon appétit, baby (Bon appétit)
Appetite for seduction
Fresh out the oven (Fresh out the oven)
Melt in your mouth kind of lovin'
Bon appétit, baby
'Cause I'm all that you want, boy
All that you can have, boy
Got me spread like a buffet
Bon a, bon appétit, baby (Bon appétit)
Appetite for seduction
Fresh out the oven
Melt in your mouth kind of lovin'
Bon a, bon appétit, baby
Quavo

Sweet potato pie
It'll change your mind (Change)
Got you running back for seconds (Running)
Every single night

I'm the one they say can change your life (Takeoff)
No waterfall, she drippin' wet, you like my ice? (Blast)
She say she want a Migo night
Now I ask her, "What's the price?" (Hold on)
If she do right, told her get whatever you like
Offset
I grab her legs and now divide, aight
Make her do a donut when she ride, aight
Looking at the eyes of a dime, make you blind
In her spine and my diamonds change the climate

Sweet tooth, no tooth fairy
Whipped cream, no dairy
Got her hot light on, screaming, "I'm ready"
But no horses, no carriage

'Cause I'm all that you want, boy (All that you want)
All that you can have, boy (Oh)
Got me spread like a buffet
Bon a, bon appétit, baby (Eat it up, eat it up, eat it up)
Appetite for seduction (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Fresh out the oven
Melt in your mouth kind of lovin'
Bon a, bon appétit, baby
Bon appétit

Under candlelight (Yeah, woo)
Bon appétit, baby57Embed
