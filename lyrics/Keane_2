Everybodyâ€™s Changing Lyrics
You say you wander your own land
But when I think about it
I don't see how you can
You're aching, you're breaking
And I can see the pain in your eyes
Says everybody's changing
And I don't know why

So little time
Try to understand that I'm
Trying to make a move just to stay in the game, I
Try to stay awake and remember my name, but
Everybody's changing
And I don't feel the same

You're gone from here
Soon you will disappear
Fading into beautiful light
'Cause everybody's changing
And I don't feel right

So little time
Try to understand that I'm
Trying to make a move just to stay in the game, I
Try to stay awake and remember my name, but
Everybody's changing
And I don't feel the same

So little time
Try to understand that I'm
Trying to make a move just to stay in the game, I
Try to stay awake and remember my name, but
Everybody's changing
And I don't feel the same
Ah! Everybody's changing
And I don't feel the same22Embed
