Temperature Lyrics
Di gyaldem Schillaci, Sean da Paul
Suh mi give it to, suh mi give it to
Suh mi give it to, to all girls
Five million and forty naughty shorty
Baby girl, all my girls
All my girls, Sean da Paul seh

Well woman, the way the time cold, I wanna be keepin' you warm
I got the right temperature fi shelter you from the storm
Oh Lord, gyal, I got the right tactics to turn you on
And girl, I wanna be the papa, you can be the mom, oh, oh!

Make I see di gyal dem breakout 'pon di floor
From you don't want no worthless performer (Oh, oh)
From you don't want no man weh can't turn you on
Gyal, make I see your hand dem up on ya (Oh, oh)
Can't tan 'pon it long, nah eat no yam
No steam fish, nor no green banana (Oh, oh)
But down in Jamaica
We give it to you hot like a sauna

Well woman, the way the time cold, I wanna be keepin' you warm
I got the right temperature fi shelter you from the storm
Oh Lord, gyal, I got the right tactics to turn you on
And girl, I wanna be the papa, you can be the mom, oh, oh!
Bumper exposed and gyal, ya got your chest out
But you no wasters 'cause gyal, ya impress out (Oh, oh)
And if ya diss out a me, ya fi test out
'Cause I got the remedy fi make ya de-stress out (Oh, oh)
Mi haffi flaunt it, become a God bless out
And girl, if you want it, you haffi confess out (Oh, oh)
I no lie, weh we need, set speed
Haffi test the mattress out

Well woman, the way the time cold, I wanna be keepin' you warm
I got the right temperature fi shelter you from the storm
Oh Lord, gyal, I got the right tactics to turn you on
And girl, I wanna be the papa, you can be the mom, oh, oh

Gyal, don't say me crazy now
This strange love it a no Brigitte and Flavor show (Oh, oh)
Time fi we make baby now
So stop, gwaan like you a actin' shady, yo (Oh, oh)
Woman, don't play me now
'Cause I no Fred Sanford, not Grady, yo (Oh, oh)
My lovin' is the way to go

Well woman, the way the time cold, I wanna be keepin' you warm
I got the right temperature fi shelter you from the storm
Oh Lord, gyal, I got the right tactics to turn you on
And girl, I wanna be the papa, you can be the mom, oh, oh!

When you roll with a player like me
With a bredda like me, gyal, there is no other (Oh, oh)
No need to talk it right here
Just park it right here, keep it undercover (Oh, oh)
From me love how you fit inna your blouse
And you fat inna your jeans and mi wan' discover (Oh, oh)

Can't tan 'pon it long, nah eat no yam
No steam fish, nor no green banana (Oh, oh)
