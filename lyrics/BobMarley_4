Roots Lyrics
Roots Natty roots
Dread Binghi dread
I and I are the roots
Some are the dry wood

Fe catch up the fire
Look at that
They need some dry wood
To cook up the raw food
Look at that
I got to survive
In this man maniac downpression
Got to survive
In iration


Some are wolf
In  sheep's clothing
Look at that
Many are called
But only a few are chosen
Look at that
Nothing they can do
To separate I and I from the law of our father
Look at that
You see, blood is thicker than water
Look at that
 

Some are leaves
While some are branches
But remember I and I are the roots
Some are dry wood
Fe catch up the fire
Look at that

Got to survive
In this man maniac downpression
Got to survive
In iration
