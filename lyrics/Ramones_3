Pet Sematary Lyrics
Under the arc of a weather stain boards
Ancient goblins and warlords
Come out of the ground, not making a sound
The smell of death is all around
And the night when the cold wind blows
No one cares, nobody knows

I don't wanna be buried in a pet sematary
I don't want to live my life again
I don't wanna be buried in a pet sematary
I don't want to live my life again

Follow Victor to the sacred place
This ain't a dream, I can't escape
Molars and fangs, the clicking of bones
Spirits moaning among the tombstones
And the night, when the moon is bright
Someone cries, something ain't right

I don't wanna be buried in a pet sematary
I don't want to live my life again
I don't wanna be buried in a pet sematary
I don't want to live my life again
The moon is full, the air is still
All of a sudden I feel a chill
Victor is grinning, flesh rotting away
Skeletons dance, I curse this day
And the night when the wolves cry out
Listen close and you can hear me shout
I don't wanna be buried in a pet sematary
I don't want to live my life again
I don't wanna be buried in a pet sematary
I don't want to live my life again

Oh no, oh no
I don't want to live my life not again, oh no, oh oh
I don't want to live my life not again, oh no no no
I don't want to live my life not again, oh oh4Embed
