RITMO (Bad Boys for Life) * LyricsLyrics from Snippet:

This is the rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm
This is the rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm
This is the rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm of the night

Tonight's gonna be bueno (The night)
I'm talking no problemo (Oh, yeah)
We party to the extremo, baby
(This is the rhythm of the night)
Baby, tonight's like fuego (The night)
We 'bout to spend the dinero (Oh, yeah)Embed
