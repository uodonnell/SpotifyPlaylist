Cute Without the ‘E’ (Cut from the Team) Lyrics
Your lipstick, his collar
Don't bother, angel
I know exactly what goes on

When everything you'll get is everything that you've wanted, princess
(Well, which would you prefer?)
My finger on the trigger, or
(Me face down, down across your floor?)
Me face down, dead across your floor
(Me face down, down across your floor)
Well, just so long as this thing's loaded

And will you tell all your friends
You've got your gun to my head?
This all was only wishful thinking
This all was only wishful thinking
And will you tell all your friends
You've got your gun to my head?
This all was only wishful thinking
This all was only wishful thinking
Let's go

Don't bother trying to explain, angel
I know exactly what goes on when you're on, and
How 'bout I'm outside of your window?
(Well, how 'bout I'm outside of your window)
Watching him keep the details covered?
You're such a sucker for a sweet talker, yeah
(You're such a sucker)
And will you tell all your friends
You've got your gun to my head?
This all was only wishful thinking
This all was only wishful thinking
(The only thing I regret is that I
I never let you hold me back)
And will you tell all your friends
You've got your gun to my head?
This all was only wishful thinking
This all was only wishful thinking

Hoping for the best just hoping nothing happens
A thousand clever lines unread on clever napkins
I will never ask if you don't ever tell me
I know you well enough to know you'll never love me
(Why can't I feel anything from anyone other than you?)
Hoping for the best just hoping nothing happens
A thousand clever lines unread on clever napkins
I will never ask if you don't ever tell me
I know you well enough to know you'll never love me
(Why can't I feel anything from anyone other than you?)
Hoping for the best just hoping nothing happens
A thousand clever lines unread on clever napkins
I will never ask if you don't ever tell me
I know you well enough to know you'll never love me
And all of this was all your fault
And all of this
(It makes things worse)
I stay wrecked and jealous for this
For this simple reason I
Just need to keep you in mind
As something larger than life
(She’ll destroy us all before she’s through
And find a way to blame somebody else)
I stay wrecked and jealous for this
For this simple reason I
Just need to keep you in mind
As something larger than life
(She’ll destroy us all before she’s through
And find a way to blame somebody else)
I stay wrecked and jealous for this
For this simple reason I
Just need to keep you in mind
As something larger than life11Embed
