The World Is Not Enough Lyrics
I know how to hurt, I know how to heal
I know what to show and what to conceal
I know when to talk and I know when to touch
No one ever died from wanting too much

The world is not enough
But it is such a perfect place to start, my love
And if you're strong enough
Together we can take the world apart, my love

People like us know how to survive
There's no point in living if you can't feel alive
We know when to kiss and we know when to kill
If we can't have it all, then nobody will

The world is not enough
But it is such a perfect place to start, my love
And if you're strong enough
Together we can take the world apart, my love

I feel safe
I feel scared
I feel ready
And yet unprepared
The world is not enough
But it is such a perfect place to start, my love
And if you're strong enough
Together we can take the world apart, my love

The world is not enough
The world is not enough
No, nowhere near enough
The world is not enough5Embed
