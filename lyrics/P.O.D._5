Southtown Lyrics
Welcome to hard times
Back again like its never been, for the first time
It seems to mess with my head
So when I realize what it takes can I relate
With whatever but never will it drive me to hate
Could be the next guy that you take before I wake
Now I lay me down to sleep, eyes tight when I pray
This here is real life, circumstances make you think
Should I be counting my blessings
The next second my eyes blink?

Here in the Southtown, hey you know that kids don't play
Put it down in the streets, will I see another day
If I make it back this time, gots to hold what is mine
And thank God that I made it alive
Here in the Southtown, hey you know that kids don't play
Put it down in the streets, will I see another day
If I make it back this time, gots to hold what is mine
And thank God that I made it alive

One love, its easier said than done
Can I rise above everything that's in my way?
Like words you say
You let your tongue get loose
But when push comes to shove, not used to walking away
I keep on looking up, cause these times, they getting tough
Tomorrow's gone, and its the same old song
Father fill my cup, give me strength to power up
A life to shine, you're the diamond in this rough
Here in the Southtown, hey you know that kids don't play
Put it down in the streets, will I see another day
If I make it back this time, gots to hold what is mine
And thank God that I made it alive
Here in the Southtown, hey you know that kids don't play
Put it down in the streets, will I see another day
If I make it back this time, gots to hold what is mine
And thank God that I made it alive

Don't wanna throw up my fist, ain't gots to be like this
Don't wanna throw up my fist, I must resist
Don't wanna throw up my fist, I must resist
Don't wanna throw up my fist, I must resist
Don't wanna throw up my fist, I must resist
It ain't gots to be (Like this)
It ain't gots to be (Like this)
It ain't gots to be (Like this)
It ain't gots to be (Like this)
Like this, ain't gots to be like this (Like this)
Like this, ain't gots to be like this (Like this)
Like this, ain't gots to be like this (Like this)
Like this, ain't gots to be, like, this (Here in the Southtown!)
Like this
Here in the Southtown, hey you know that kids don't play
Put it down in the streets, will I see another day
If I make it back this time, gots to hold what is mine
And thank God that I made it alive
Here in the Southtown, you know that kids don't play
Put it down in the streets, will I see another day
If I make it back this time, gots to hold what is mine
And thank God that I made it alive
