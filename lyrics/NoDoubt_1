Donâ€™t Speak Lyrics
You and me
We used to be together
Every day together, always
I really feel
That I'm losing my best friend
I can't believe this could be the end

It looks as though
You're letting go
And if it's real, well, I don't want to know

Don't speak
I know just what you're saying
So please stop explaining
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
Don't speak
I know what you're thinkin'
I don't need your reasons
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

Our memories
They can be inviting
But some are altogether mighty frightening
As we die
Both you and I
With my head in my hands, I sit and cry

Don't speak
I know just what you're saying
So please stop explaining
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts, no, no, no
Don't speak
I know what you're thinkin'
And I don't need your reasons
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

It's all ending
I gotta stop pretending
Who we are


You and me
I can see us dying
Are we?
Don't speak
I know just what you're saying
So please stop explaining
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
No, no, don't speak
I know what you're thinkin'
And I don't need your reasons
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

I know what you're saying
So please stop explaining
Don't speak, don't speak
Don't speak, no
I know what you're thinkin'
And I don't need your reasons
I know you're good
I know you're good
I know you're real good, oh

La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
Don't, don't, ooh, ooh
Hush, hush, darlin'
Hush, hush, darlin'
Hush, hush, don't tell me 'cause it hurts
Hush, hush, darlin'
Hush, hush, darlin'
Hush, hush, don't tell me 'cause it hurts
Oh, hush, hush, darlin'
Hush, hush, darlin'37Embed
