BLUE Lyrics
Feeling blue without you
Give me one more chance, give me one more dance
I'm feeling blue without you
Tell me who am I to hold you down
Just feeling blue without you
Give me one more chance, give me one more dance
I'm feeling blue without you
Tell me who am I to hold you down

I dream that you won't forget me
That's all I really ask of ya
I'd love to talk if you'd let me
I'll take you back to the start with me

I keep on dreaming, I don't know why
I can't seem to let it go
But I keep on tripping on what we had
It's hard not to let you know

I'm feeling blue without you
Give me one more chance, give me one more dance
I'm feeling blue without you
Tell me who am I to hold you down
I'm feeling blue without you
I don't know what I should do-o-o-o
Feeling so blue without you
We built our love on foundations
We built a house on the hill, yeah
Our little rock of salvation
Oh, my love's there still

'Cause I keep on dreaming, I don't know why
I can't seem to let it go
But I keep on tripping on what we had
It's hard not to let you know

I'm feeling blue without you
Give me one more chance, give me one more dance
I'm feeling blue without you
Tell me who am I to hold you down
I'm feeling blue, yeah
Oh, give me one more chance, give me one more dance
I'm blue without you
Tell me who am I to hold you down
Just feeling blue without youEmbed
