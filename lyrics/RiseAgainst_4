Make It Stop (September’s Children) Lyrics
Woah, woah

Bang bang go the coffin nails
Like a breath exhaled, then gone forever
It seems like just yesterday
How did I miss the red flags raised?
Think back to the days we laughed
We braved these bitter storms together
Brought to his knees he cried
But on his feet he died
What God would damn a heart?
And what God drove us apart?
What God could?
Make it stop, let this end
Eighteen years pushed to the ledge
It's come to this, a weightless step
On the way down singing
Woah, woah

Bang bang from the closet walls
The schoolhouse halls, the shotgun's loaded
Push me and I'll push back
I'm done asking, I demand
From the nation under God
I feel its love like a cattle prod
Born free but still, they hate
Born me, no I can't change
It's always darkest just before the dawn
So stay awake with me, let's prove them wrong
Make it stop, let this end
Eighteen years pushed to the ledge
It's come to this, a weightless step
On the way down singing
Woah, woah

The cold river washed him away
But how could we forget?
The gatherings hold candles, but not their tongues
And too much blood has flown from the wrists
Of the children shamed for those they chose to kiss
Who will rise to stop the blood?
We're calling for, insisting on
A different beat, yeah
A brand new song

Billy Lucas, age 15
Harrison Chase Brown, age 15
Cody J. Barker, age 17
Seth Walsh, age 13
Make it stop, let this end
This life chose me, I’m not lost in sin
But proud I stand of who I am
I plan to go on living
Make it stop, let this end
All these years pushed to the ledge
But proud I stand of who I am
I plan to go on living30Embed
