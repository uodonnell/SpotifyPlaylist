Love Like This Lyrics
Ooh, oh (Talk to 'em, babe)
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Never find a love like this
Whoa, whoa, whoa (Hey! Let's go)
Never find a love like this (Ooh, oh)

Well, we go back so far
Swinging in your backyard
All the things that we used to do
We were cool back in high school
Ooh, I really liked you
Must've been your attitude

That's why you keep on running
In and out of my mind
As the years, they all roll by
Baby, now I know why
I keep coming back to you (Skrr!)

You're the only one that knows me
Love it when you hold me
Never find a love like this (Let me hear you say)
Now I'll never be lonely
Look at what you've shown me
Never find a love like this
Well, this life tried to keep us apart
You keep calling me back to your heart
Let me hear you say
I'm so glad you found me
Wrap your world around me (Yeah-eh, eh)
Never find a love like this
(Love like this)
All the guys tried to take me
You're the one who saved me
I feel like I owe you my life (Oh) (Owe you my life)
And as strange as it may seem
I'll go if you take me
I'm willing to sacrifice

That's why you keep on running
In and out of my mind (Come on!)
As the years they all roll by
It's not hard to know why
I keep coming back to you (Say what?)

You're the only one that knows me (You're the only one, who knows me)
Love it when you hold me (Oh)
Never find a love like this (Let me hear you say)
Now I'll never be lonely
Ooh, look at what you've shown me
Never find a love like this
Well, this life tried to keep us apart
You keep calling me back to your heart
Let me hear you say
I'm so glad you found me
Oh, wrap your world around me
Never find a love like this, oh
Mi never find a luh, luh-luh, love like this
That still make me think about my middle school kiss (That's right!)
I sit here in this chair and I wish
For you not to leave me now (Let's go!)
My friends, they always told me
Not to make you my wifey
Man, they was putting you down (Hey!)
And now they see we rollin'
Me and you, we strollin'
They don't wanna come around

(Let me hear you say!)
You're the only one that knows me
Love it when you hold me (Ah)
Never find a love like this (Let me hear you say) (Love like this)
Now I'll never be lonely
Look at what you've shown me
Never find a love like this
Well, this life tried to keep us apart
You keep calling me back to your heart
Let me hear you say
I'm so glad you found me (Hey!)
Wrap your world around me (Hey!)
Never find a love like this (I see what I like right here)
Oh, oh, oh (Hey!)
Oh, oh (Watch, everybody!)
Never find a love like this (Rock side to side)
Oh, oh, oh (Oh, oh) (Put one finger in the air, I sing)
Oh, oh (Oh, oh)
Never find a love like this (Love like this)
Oh, oh, oh (Oh, oh) (Say what?)
Oh, oh (Oh, oh) (Say what?)
Never find a love like this (Come on!) (No I'll never be lonely)
Oh, oh, oh (Look at what you showed me)
Oh, oh (I'll never find a love like this)
Never find a love like this (Let me hear you say)
Oh, oh, oh (Oh, oh) (Break up right now!)
Oh, oh (Oh, oh)
Never find a love like this (Everybody sing!)
Oh, oh, oh (Well, this life tried to keep us apart)
Oh, oh (You keep calling me back to your heart)
Never find a love like this (Let me hear you say)
Oh, oh, oh (Oh, oh) (Natasha!)
Oh, oh (Oh, oh) (Kingston!)
Never find a love like this (Love like this)
Oh, oh, oh (Oh, oh)
Oh, oh
Never find a love like this7Embed
