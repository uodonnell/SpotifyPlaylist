Walk on Water Lyrics
(Do you believe?) Walk on water

Can you even see what you're fighting for?
Blood lust and a holy war
Listen up, hear the patriot shout:
"Times are changing"
In the end, the choice was clear
Take a shot in the face of fear
Fist up in the firing line
Times are changing

Do you believe that you can walk on water?
Do you believe that you can win this fight tonight?
(Do you believe?)

Look at the sky, see a dying star
A white lie, sets a man on fire
Making love with the devil hurts
Times are changing
A thin line, the whole truth
The far right, the left view
Breaking all those promises made
Times are changing
Do you believe that you can walk on water?
Do you believe that you can win this fight tonight?
Do you believe that you can walk on water?
Do you believe that you can win this fight tonight?

Do you believe? Walk on water
Do you believe? Walk on water
Do you believe? Walk on water
Do you believe? Walk on water
Do you believe? Walk on water
Do you believe? Walk on water
Do you believe? Walk on water
Do you believe? Walk on water

Do you believe that you can walk on water?
Do you believe that you can win this fight tonight?
Do you believe? Walk on water
Do you believe that you can walk on water?
Do you believe? Walk on water
Do you believe that you can win this fight tonight?

Do you believe? Walk on water
Do you believe? Walk on water16Embed
