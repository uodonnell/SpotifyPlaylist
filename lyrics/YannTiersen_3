Monochrome LyricsAnyway, I can try anything it's the same circle leading to nowhere and I'm tired now
Anyway, I've lost my face, my dignity, my look, everything is gone and I'm tired now
Don't be scared, I found a good job and I go to work every day on my old bicycle you loved
I am piling up some unread books under in my bed and I really think I'll never read again
No concentration, just a white disorder everywhere around me, you know I'm so tired now
Don't worry, I often go to dinners and parties with some old friends who care for me, take me back home and stay
Monochrome floors, monochrome walls, only absence near me, nothing but silence around me
Monochrome flat, monochrome life, only absence near me, nothing but silence around me
Sometimes I search an event or something to remind me, but I've really got nothing in mind
Sometimes I open the windows and listen people walking in the down streets. There is life out there
Don't be scared, I found a good job and I go to work every day on my old bicycle you loved
Anyway, I can try anything it's the same circle leading to nowhere and I'm tired now
Anyway, I've lost my face, my dignity, my look, everything is gone and I'm tired now
Don't worry, I often go to dinners and parties with some old friends who care for me, take me back home and stay
Monochrome floors, monochrome walls, only absence near me, nothing but silence around me
Monochrome flat, monochrome life, only absence near me, nothing but silence around me1Embed
