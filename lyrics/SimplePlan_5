Untitled (How Could This Happen to Me?) Lyrics
I open my eyes
I try to see, but I’m blinded by the white light
I can’t remember how, I can’t remember why
I’m lying here tonight
And I can’t stand the pain
And I can’t make it go away
No, I can’t stand the pain

How could this happen to me?
I've made my mistakes
Got nowhere to run
The night goes on as I’m fading away
I’m sick of this life
I just wanna scream
How could this happen to me?

Everybody’s screaming
I try to make a sound, but no one hears me
I’m slipping off the edge, I’m hanging by a thread
I wanna start this over again
So I try to hold on to a time when nothing mattered
And I can’t explain what happened
And I can’t erase the things that I've done
No, I can’t
How could this happen to me?
I've made my mistakes
Got nowhere to run
The night goes on as I’m fading away
I’m sick of this life
I just wanna scream
How could this happen to me?

I've made my mistakes
Got nowhere to run
The night goes on as I’m fading away
I’m sick of this life
I just wanna scream
How could this happen to me?14Embed
