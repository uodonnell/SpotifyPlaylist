Take This Life Lyrics
It's not so much the pain
It's more the actual knife
Pretending the picture is perfect
I cut myself to sleep
I close my eyes for a second
And meet a fragile soul
I scream to hide that I'm lonely
The echo calls my name

If I ever, if I never
Make me understand the thought whatever
Make me see, make me be
Make me understand you're there for me

Take this life, I'm right here
Stay awhile and breathe me in
Take this life, I'm right here
Stay awhile and breathe me in

The water drops just beg to hit me
Why now? Hasn't rained for days
No time to play hide and seek
I call upon you to take me on
Break me down to pieces
Put me back, do it right this time
Struggling to fill this empty shell
Burn all my efforts
In the end it means nothing
If I ever, If I never
Make me understand the thought whatever
Make me see, make me be
Make me understand you're there for me

Take this life, I'm right here
Stay awhile and breathe me in
Take this life, I'm right here
Stay awhile and breathe me in

These thoughts, burn a hole in my heart
These thoughts, will keep me feeling
These thoughts, burn a hole in my heart
These thoughts, will keep me feeling

If I ever, if I never
Make me understand the thought whatever
Make me see, make me be
Make me understand you're there for me

Take this life, I'm right here
Stay awhile and breathe me in
Take this life, I'm right here
Stay awhile and breathe me in1Embed
