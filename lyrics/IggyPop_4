Look Away LyricsI slept with Sable when she was 13
Her parents were too rich to do anything
She rocked her way around LA
'Til a New York Doll carried her away
Look away
Look away
Now he was blond and she was dark
They called him Thunder 'cause he had the spark
The dream he dreamed was straight and pure
But the confusion of life was gonna get him for sure
Look away
Look away
They shared their clothes and their cowboy boots
Left them all over the floor while they dyed their roots
They live the dream and they went non-stop
They did ok 'til the band broke up
Look away
Look away
Look away
Look away
Unfortunately, the needle broke
Their rock and roll love like a bicycle spoke
I found her in a back street with her looks half gone
She was sellin' something that I was on
Look away
Look away
Now Thunder and me did not part friends
What we did once, I wouldn't do again
So he stayed with the pure dream and followed the moon
'Til the drugs in his body made his mind a cartoon
Look away
Look away
So a few years later, Thunder died broke
Sable had a baby back at her folks'
Me, I went straight and serious, too
There wasn't much else that I could do
Look away
Look away
So now that I'm straight, I'm settled, too
I eat and I sleep and I work like you
I got lots of feelings, but I hold them down
That's a way I cope with this shitty town
Look away
Look away
Look away
