Take on Me (MTV Unplugged) Lyrics
Talking away
I don't know what I'm to say
I'll say it anyway
Today's another day to find you
Shyin' away
I'll be coming for your love, okay? And

Take on me
Take me on
I'll be gone
In a day or two

So needless to say
I'm odds and ends
But that's me, I'm stumbling away
Slowly learning that life is OK, and
Say after me
It's no better to be safe than sorry, and

Take on me
Take me on
I'll be gone
In a day or two
And oh, things that you say
Is it life or just to play my worries away?
You're all the things I've got to remember
You're shyin' away
I'll be coming for you anyway

Take on me
Take me on
I'll be gone
In a day or two
I'll be gone
In a day or two
In a day or two

Thank you very much, thank you very much
Thank you so much, thank you guys
Thank you, thank you very much
Thank you, you're wonderful, wonderful
Thank you for coming, everybody3Embed
