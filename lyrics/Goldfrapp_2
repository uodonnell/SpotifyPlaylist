Ocean (Duet Version) Lyrics
I lost the will too
I lost my way
I lost this ocean
It poisoned me

People collector
People collector
I'm on the move
For you

Oh, and I
Wouldn't lie
Wanna be your...

I borrowed bones, I borrowed skin
To save me from the hell I'm in
Your fantasy
And every time I think of you
I see the dark, I hear their hooves
They're coming
They're coming
For you
I've lost the will too
I've lost my way
I've lost this ocean
I poisoned me

People collecting
People collecting
I'm on the move
For you

Oh, and I
(Oh, and I)
Wouldn't lie
(Wouldn't lie)
Wanna be your...
(Wanna be your...)

I borrowed bones, I borrowed skin
To save me from the hell I'm in
Your fantasy
And every time I think of you
I see the dark, I hear their hooves
They're coming
They're coming
For youEmbed
