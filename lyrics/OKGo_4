Upside Down & Inside Out Lyrics
Upside down and inside out
And you can feel it
Upside down and inside out
And you can feel it, feel it

Don't know where your eyes are
But they're not doin' what you said
Don't know where your mind is, baby
But you're better off without it

Inside down and upside out
And you can feel it
Don't stop, can't stop
It's like an airplane goin' down

I wish I had said the things you thought that I had said
Gravity's just a habit that you're really sure you can't break

So when you met the new you
Were you scared? Were you cold? Were you kind?
Yeah when you met the new you
Did someone die inside?
Don't stop, can't stop
It's like a freight train
Don't stop, can't stop
It's like an airplane goin' down

Don't know where your eyes are
But they're not doin' what you said
Don't know where your mind is, baby
But you're better off without it

Looks like it's time to decide
Are you here? Are you now? Is this it?
All of those selves that you tried
Wasn't one of 'em good enough?

'Cause you're upside down and inside out
And you can feel it
Inside down and upside out
And you can feel it, feel it

Don't stop, can't stop
It's like a freight train
Don't stop, can't stop
Until you feel it goin' down
I wish I had said the things you thought that I had said
(Are you scared? Are you cold? Were you kind?)
Gravity's just a habit that you're really sure you can't break
(Are you here? Are you now? Is this it?)

Upside down and inside out
And you can feel it
Don't stop, can't stop
Until you feel it goin' down
Upside down and inside out
And you can feel it
Don't stop, can't stop
Until you feel it goin' down4Embed
