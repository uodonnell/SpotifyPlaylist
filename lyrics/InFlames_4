I, the Mask Lyrics
From here, I can hardly see a thing
We're further off with every passing second
I will follow anyone that brings me to you
But the sense of time is catching up with me

Will you see me if I set fire to the sky?
If I act like I'm untouchable and golden?

Wonder when I'll hit the ground
Been to space, but I am falling
Wasting what is mine
For a voice that's calling

Who am I?
So many faces, dressed in rags for all to see
Here I am in the mask
The jester that wants to be free

I am done with watching graves grow mould
The sins are mine, I believe them to be
All the tears, they're draining me
We find the truth through tragedy
Give me a sign, I'm on my knees
Feel like you've forgotten me

Who am I?
So many faces, dressed in rags for all to see
Here I am in the mask
The jester that wants to be free

How could you leave me behind?
I'm tired, and I felt it for some time
I can't take this much longer
I'm stuck in a downward spiral
I'm stuck in a downward spiral
I'm stuck in a downward spiral


All the tears, they're draining me
We find the truth through tragedy
Give me a sign, give me a sign
Who am I?
So many faces, dressed in rags for all to see
Here I am, in the mask
The jester that wants to be free

Will you see me if I set fire to the sky?Embed
