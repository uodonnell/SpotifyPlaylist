Never Ever Lyrics
I've been dying to see you
Hoping for a chance to talk
I really wanna be near you
Tell you how I feel inside

Oh, wanna get to know you
Oh, wanna shout it out
Wanna really show you
Oh, what it's all about

Never ever gonna let you go now
I don't wanna cry
Never ever gonna let you go now
Not that I'm in love

Every time that I see you
I just wanna stay awhile
And I want you to be here
Don't wanna be alone tonight

Oh, wanna get to know you
Oh, wanna shout it out
Wanna really show you
Oh, what it's all about
Never ever gonna let you go now
I don't wanna cry
Never ever gonna let you go now
Not that I'm in love
Never ever gonna let you go now
I don't wanna cry
Never ever gonna let you go now
Not that I'm in love

I don't, I don't
I don't
I don't wanna cry
Never ever gonna let you go now

I don't, I don't get
Get, get, get, get, get you, you, you
Get, get, get, get, get you, you, you
Never ever gonna let you go now
Never ever gonna let you go now
Get, get, get, get, get you, you, you
Get, get, get, get, get you, you, youEmbed
