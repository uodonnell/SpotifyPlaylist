There’s No ‘I’ in Team Lyrics
Well I can't regret
Can't you just forget it?
I started something I couldn't finish
And if we go down, we go down together
Best friends means
Well best friends means
And I've got a twenty-dollar bill
That says you're up late night starting
Fist fights vs. fences in your backyard
Wearing your black eye like a badge of honor
Soakin' in sympathy
From friends who never loved you
Nearly half as much as me

Broken down in bars and bathrooms
All I did was what I had to
Don't believe me when I tell you
"it's just what anyone would do"
Take the time to talk about it
Think a lot and live without it
Don't believe me when I tell you
"it's something unforgivable"
Well I can't regret
Can't you just forget it?
I started something I couldn't finish
If we go down, we go down together
Best friends means
Well best friends means
You never knew
Well I never told you...
Everything I know about breaking hearts
I learned from you, it's true
I've never done it with the style and grace you have
But I've made long term plans
Based on these mistakes

Broken down in bars and bathrooms
All I did was what I had to
Don't believe me when I tell you
"it's just what anyone would do"
Take the time to talk about it
Think a lot and live without it
Don't believe me when I tell you
"it's something unforgivable"
Is this what you call tact?
I swear you're as subtle as a brick in the small of my back
So let's end this call
And end this conversation
There's nothing worse...
(that's right he said, that's right he said it)
I swear, you have no idea
The jealousy that became got me thinking
(that's right he said)
That you always had it way too easy

Broken down in bars and bathrooms
All I did was what I had to
Don't believe me when I tell you
"it's just what anyone would do"
Take the time to talk about it
Think a lot and live without it
Don't believe me when I tell you
"it's something unforgivable"

Best friends means I pulled the trigger
Best friends means you get what you deserve
Best friends means I pulled the trigger
Best friends means you get what you deserve
Best friends means I pulled the trigger
Best friends means you get what you deserve
Best friends means I pulled the trigger
Best friends means you get what you deserve
Best friends means I pulled the trigger
Best friends means you get what you deserve
Best friend thinks I pulled the trigger!
Best friend thinks you get what you deserve!7Embed
