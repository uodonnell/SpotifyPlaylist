Where Does the Good Go Lyrics
Where do you go with your broken heart in tow?
What do you do with the left over you?
And how do you know when to let go?
Where does the good go, where does the good go?

Look me in the eye and tell me you don't find me attractive
Look me in the heart and tell me you won't go
Look me in the eye and promise no love is like our love
Look me in the heart and unbreak broken, it won't happen

It's love that leaves and breaks the seal
Of always thinking you would be real
Happy and healthy, strong and calm
Where does the good go?
Where does the good go?

Where do you go when you're in love and the world knows?
How do you live so happily while I am sad and broken down?
What do you say? "It's up for grabs now that you're on your way down?"
Where does the good go, where does the good go?

Look me in the eye and tell me you don't find me attractive
Look me in the heart and tell me you won't go
Look me in the eye and promise no love is like our love
Look me in the heart and unbreak broken, it won't happen
It's love that leaves and breaks the seal
Of always thinking you would be real
Happy and healthy, strong and calm
Where does the good go?
Where does the good go?

Look me in the eye and tell me you don't find me attractive
Look me in the heart and tell me you won't go
Look me in the eye and promise no love's like our love
Look me in the heart and unbreak broken, it won't happen

It's love that leaves and breaks the seal
Of always thinking you would be real
Happy and healthy, strong and calm
Where does the good go?
Where does the good go?
It's love that leaves and breaks the seal
Of always thinking you would be real
Happy and healthy, strong and calm
Where does the good go?
Where does the good go?

Where does the good go?
Where does the good go?
Where does the good go?
Where does the good go?
Where does the good go?
Where does the good go?
Where does the good go?
Where does the good go?
Where does the good go?
Where does the good go?
Where does the good go?
Where does the good go?
Where does the good go?7Embed
