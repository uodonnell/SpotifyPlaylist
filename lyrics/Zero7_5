Don’t Call It Love LyricsBlame it on the street lights
Fingernail moonlight
The way that you kiss me
How your face hit the moon
Blame it on the twilight
Waning other daylight
The way you held my hand
How you never would let go
(chorus)
Oh baby don’t get caught up
Don’t surrender to the touch
You can say anything your heart’s dreaming of
But don’t call it love
Call it a longing
Call it a yearning
Don’t call it love
Call it a sweet dream
Shh don’t say nothing
It’s like a beautiful car crash
Where two people collide
Nobody gets hurt and
No one’s left behind
And when I dive into your light
We swim past the riptide
And maybe this is everything
Yeh that we’ve been waiting for
But don’t call it love
Call it a longing
Call it a yearning
Don’t call it loveEmbed
