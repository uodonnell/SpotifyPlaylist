â€‹xxzxcuzx me Lyrics
We can insist on havoc
Bring it to us
Pleasure our insides
You said, leave me for dead
How can your love
Program the head?

We get so fed up with it
Nuts and bolts for granted
Run, I can do it
As your bodies fall apart

Robotic love
I'm programmed to rust
AIDS robot
Is grinding iron bolts

Robot hunks have one agenda
They wanna play with my placenta
Are we now deserving
When our cyborg parts are burning?
I know we're just diseased appliances
Where will you live?
What will you die for?
Sex is killing me
Baby, I know
Wrong time
Wrong place
Wrong fucking race
Just because we don't feel flesh
Doesn't mean we don't fear death18Embed
