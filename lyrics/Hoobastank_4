Same Direction Lyrics
Whenever I step outside
Somebody claims to see the light
It seems to me that all of us have lost our patience
Cause everyone thinks they're right
And nobody thinks that there just might
Be more than one road to our final destination

But I'm not ever gonna know if I'm right or wrong
Cause we're all going in the same direction
And I'm not sure which way to go
Because all along, we've been going in the same direction

I'm tired of playing games
Of looking for someone else to blame
For all the holes in answers that are clearly showing
For something to fill the space
Was all of the time I spent a waste
Cause so many choices point the same way I was going

But I'm not ever gonna know if I'm right or wrong
Cause we're all going in the same direction
And I'm not sure which way to go
Because all along, we've been going in the same direction
Going in the same direction
Same direction (same direction)
So why does there only have to be one correct philosophy?
I don't wanna go and follow you just to end up like one of them
And why are you always telling me what you want me to believe?
I'd like to think that I can
Go my own way and meet you in the end
Go my own way and meet you in the end

I'm not ever gonna know if I'm right or wrong
Cause we're all going in the same direction
And I'm not sure which way to go
Because all along, we've been going in the same direction
Going in the same direction
Going in the same direction
Same direction (same direction)Embed
