We Gotta Get Outta This Place LyricsIn this dirty old part of the city
Where the sun refused to shine
People tell me there ain't no use in tryin'
Now my girl, you're so young and pretty
And one thing I know is true
You'll be dead before your time is due, I know
Watch my daddy in bed a-dyin'
Watched his hair been turnin' grey
He's been workin' and slavin' his life away
Oh, yes I know it
(Yeah) And I've been workin' too, baby
(Yeah) Every night and day
(Yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We gotta get outta this place
If it's the last thing we ever do
We gotta get outta this place
'Cause girl, there's a better life for me and you
Now my girl, you're so young and pretty
And one thing I know is true
You'll be dead before your time is due, I know
Watch my daddy in bed a-dyin'
Watched his hair been turnin' grey
He's been workin' and slavin' his life away
I know he's been workin' so hard
(Yeah) Every day, baby
(Yeah) Whoa, ohhh...
(Yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We gotta get outta this place
If it's the last thing we ever do
We gotta get outta this place
Girl, there's a better life for me and you
Somewhere, baby
Somehow I know it, baby
We gotta get outta this place
If it's the last thing we ever do
We gotta get outta this place
Girl, there's a better life for me and you
Believe me, baby
I know it, baby
You know it too2Embed
