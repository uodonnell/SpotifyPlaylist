Stonemilker Lyrics
A juxtapositioning fate
Find our mutual coordinates

Moments of clarity are so rare
I better document this
At last the view is fierce
All that matters is

Who is open chested
And who has coagulated
Who can share and
Who has shut down the chances?

Show me emotional respect, oh respect, oh respect
And I have emotional needs, oh needs, oh ooh
I wish to synchronize our feelings, our feelings, oh ooh

What is it that I have
That makes me feel your pain?
Like milking a stone
To get you to say it
Who is open?
And who has shut up
And if one feels closed
How does one stay open?

We have emotional needs, oh needs, oh needs, oh ooh
I wish to synchronize our feelings, our feelings, ooh
Oh, show some emotional respect, oh respect, oh ooh

A juxtapositioning fate
