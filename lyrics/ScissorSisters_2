Letâ€™s Have a Kiki Lyrics
What's up? it's Pickles; leave a message
Hey, I'm calling you back, ooh, she's been a bitch tonight! And by "bitch," I mean this rain, no cabs nowhere. So I had to put on the wigs and the heels and the lashes and the eairh and take the train to the club
And you know that MTA should stand for "Motherfuckers Touching my Ass."
So then I get to the club looking like a drowned, harassed rat and I'm greeted, not by Miss Rose at the door, but our friend, Johnny Five-Oh. Yes honey, the NYPD shut down the par-tee. So no fee for me, and I don't even know what's the tea
So I hope you're up, girl, 'cause we are all coming over
Lock the doors, lower the blinds, fire up the smoke machine and put on your heels 'cause I know exactly what we need

Let's have a kiki, I wanna have a kiki
Lock the doors tight
Let's have a kiki, motherfucker
I'm gonna let you have it
Let's have a kiki, I wanna have a kiki
Dive, turn, work
Let's have a kiki, we're gonna serve
And work, and turn, and h-h-honey

A kiki is a party for calming all your nerves
We're spilling tea and dishing just desserts one may deserve
And though the sun is rising, few may choose to leave
So shade that lid and we'll all bid adieu to your ennui
Let's have a kiki, I wanna have a kiki
Lock the doors tight
Let's have a kiki, motherfucker
I'm gonna let you have it
Let's have a kiki, I wanna have a kiki
Dive, turn, work
Let's have a kiki, we're gonna serve
And work, and turn, and h-h-honey

Oh! what a wonderful kiki...
This kiki is marvelous
(Work it, girl)
Ew, you know, girl, we were sitting back here just having a kiki
Kiki, soso, oui oui, non non
Kiki, soso, oui oui, non non
Kiki, soso, oui oui, non non
Kiki, soso, oui oui, non non

Let's have a kiki, I wanna have a kiki
Lock the doors tight
Let's have a kiki, motherfucker
I'm gonna let you have it
Let's have a kiki, I wanna have a kiki
Dive, turn, work
Let's have a kiki, we're gonna serve
And work, and turn, and h-h-honey
Let's have a kiki, I wanna have a kiki
Lock the doors tight
Let's have a kiki, hunty, drop her
I'm gonna let you have it
Let's have a kiki, I wanna have a kiki
Boots, ten, queen
Let's have a kiki, we're gonna serve
And work, and turn, and h-h-honey11Embed
