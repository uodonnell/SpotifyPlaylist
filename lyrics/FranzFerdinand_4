Always Ascending Lyrics
(Put your ladder down, put your ladder down
Put your ladder down, put your ladder down)
Don’t be concerned
It’s just the way that gravity works 'round here
All slowly rising, falling patiently
Feel no, feel no fear
Cirrus caress you, cumulus kiss you
Raindrops of crystal whisper, "We’ll miss you"
But go
Let go

Always and always and always ascending
The opening line leaves an uncertain ending
Always and always and always ascending
The chords seem to pause, but ahh–

Never gonna resolve (Never going to resolve)
Never gonna resolve (Never going to resolve)
Never gonna resolve (Never going to resolve)
Never gonna resolve (Never going to resolve)
Ah, talk to me (Talk to me)
C'mon, talk to me (Talk to me)
Yeah, talk to me (Talk to me)
Ahh, oh
Yeah, wake me up
C'mon wake me up
Waking up dry, waking up dusty
Feeling remorse, feeling thirsty
Bring me a cup, bring me water
We can ascend from this arrangement
We can see fate as entertainment
Bring me a cup, bring me water
Bring me water

Always and always and always ascending
The Shepard misleads so you think you’re transcending
Always and always and always ascending
Pause the progression, but ahh–

Never gonna resolve (Never going to resolve)
Never gonna resolve (Never going to resolve)
Never gonna resolve (Never going to resolve)
Never gonna resolve (Never going to resolve)
Ah, talk to me (Talk to me)
C'mon, talk to me (Talk to me)
Yeah, talk to me (Talk to me)
Ahh, oh
Yeah, wake me up
C'mon wake me up
Waking up dry, waking up dusty
Feeling remorse, feeling thirsty
Bring me a cup, bring me water
Yeah, bring me water, yeah, bring me water
Bring me water, bring me water, yeah

Put your ladder down, put your ladder down
Put your ladder down, put your ladder down)
Cirrus caress you, cumulus kiss you
Raindrops of crystal whisper, "We’ll miss you"
But go
Let go3Embed
