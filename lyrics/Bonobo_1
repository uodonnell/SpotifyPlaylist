Break Apart Lyrics
It's hard to take all of this haze
It's hard to take all of this haze, this haze

First move they think they never saw
Be careful with me, be careful with
Gentle with me

I should've heard your fear
So wasteful, yeah, so wasteful
I should've heard your needs
So wasteful, so wasteful, so wasteful

We've thrown apart these pieces
We've grown apart these pieces
So, I don't go home
Tell me love, tell me love

You're my favourite, you're my favourite
But we're phasing, but we're phasing
You're my favourite, you're my favourite
But we're phasing, but we're phasing
You're my favourite, you're my favourite
But we're phasing, but we're phasing
You're my favourite, you're my favourite
You're my
Instead of something to break apart
Instead, it's just broke apart
Stand up and shake this heart
Instead, it's just a break apart from us

I should've heard your fear
Shame on me
I should've heard your needs
Shame on me

Help me out, on me, help me out, on me
Help me out, on me, help me out, on me
Help me out, on me, help me out, on me
Help me out9Embed
