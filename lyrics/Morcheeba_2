Enjoy the Ride Lyrics
They shut the gates at sunset
After that you can't get out
You can see the bigger picture
Find out what it's all about
You're open to the skyline
You won't want to go back home
In a garden full of angels
You will never be alone

But oh the road is long
The stones that you are walking on
Have gone

With the moonlight to guide you
Feel the joy of being alive
The day that you stop running
Is the day that you arrive
And the night that you got locked in
Was the time to decide
Stop chasing shadows
Just enjoy the ride

If you close the door to your house
Don't let anybody in
It's a room that's full of nothing
No blood underneath your skin
Face against the window
You can watch it fade to grey
But you'll never catch the fickle wind
If you choose to stay
But oh the road is long
The stones that you are walking on
Have gone

With the moonlight to guide you
Feel the joy of being alive
The day that you stop running
Is the day that you arrive
And the night that you got locked in
Was the time to decide
Stop chasing shadows
Just enjoy the ride
Stop chasing shadows
Just enjoy the ride
With the moonlight to guide you
Feel the joy of being alive
The day that you stop running
Is the day that you arrive
And the night that you got locked in
Was the time to decide
Stop chasing shadows
Just enjoy the ride
With the moonlight to guide you
Feel the joy of being alive
The day that you stop running
Is the day that you arrive
And the night that you got locked in
Was the time to decide
Stop chasing shadows
Just enjoy the ride
Stop chasing shadows
Just enjoy the ride
Stop chasing shadows
Just enjoy the ride
Stop chasing shadows
Just enjoy the ride
Stop chasing shadows
Just enjoy the ride2Embed
