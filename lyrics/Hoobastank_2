Crawling In The Dark Lyrics
I will dedicate and sacrifice my every
Thing for just a second's worth of how my story's ending
And I wish I could know if the directions that I take
And all the choices that I make won't end up all for nothing

Show me what it's for, make me understand it
I've been crawling in the dark looking for the answer
Is there something more than what I've been handed?
I've been crawling in the dark looking for the answer

Help me carry on, assure me it's OK to
Use my heart and not my eyes to navigate the darkness
Will the ending be ever coming suddenly?
Will I ever get to see the ending to my story?

Show me what it's for, make me understand it
I've been crawling in the dark looking for the answer
Is there something more than what I've been handed?
I've been crawling in the dark looking for the answer

So when and how will I know?
How much further do I have to go?
And how much longer 'til I finally know?
`Cause I'm looking and I just can't see what's in front of me
In front of me

Show me what it's for, make me understand it
I've been crawling in the dark looking for the answer
Is there something more than what I've been handed?
I've been crawling in the dark looking for the answer2Embed
