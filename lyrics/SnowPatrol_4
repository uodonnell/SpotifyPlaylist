Life on Earth Lyrics
The first snow
First winter of my life
I was told it was the height of me
The first dance
Well, the first one that counted
Felt like my blood was built from crackling lights

All this ancient wildness
That we don't understand
The first sound of a heartbeat
To riots roaring on

This is not the love you've had before
This is something else
This is something else
This is not the same as other days
This is something else
This is something else
It shouldn't need to be so fucking hard
This is life on earth
It's just life on earth
It doesn't need to be the end of you, or me
This is life on earth
It's just life on earth
The first light
First light on the silent shore
Just the ships that anchor me and you
The way home
This is always the way home
So you can rip that map to shreds, my dear

But all we ever wanted
Seemed miles and miles from here
And the first days in a strange new land
Awaken beasts in us

This is not the love you've had before
This is something else
This is something else
This is not the same as other days
This is something else
This is something else
It shouldn't need to be so fucking hard
This is life on earth
It's just life on earth
It doesn't need to be the end of you, or me
This is life on earth
It's just life on earth
It shouldn't need to be so fucking hard
This is life on earth
It's just life on earth
It doesn't need to be the end of you, or me
This is life on earth
It's just life on earth5Embed
