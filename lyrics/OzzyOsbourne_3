Ordinary Man Lyrics
I was unprepared for fame then everybody knew my name
No more lonely nights, it's all for you
I have traveled many miles, I've seen tears and I've seen smiles
Just remember that it's all for you

Don't forget me as the colours fade
When the lights go down, it's just an empty stage
Okay

Yes, I've been a bad guy, been higher than the blue sky
And the truth is I don't wanna die an ordinary man
I've made mama cry, don't know why I'm still alive
Yes, the truth is I don't wanna die an ordinary man

Many times, I lost control, they tried to kill my rock 'n' roll
Just remember I'm still here for you
I don't wanna say goodbye, when I do, you'll be alright
After all, I did it all for you

Don't forget me as the colours fade
When the lights go down, it's just an empty stage
Okay
Yes, I've been a bad guy, been higher than the blue sky
And the truth is I don't wanna die an ordinary man
I've made mama cry, don't know why I'm still alive
Yes, the truth is I don't wanna die an ordinary man


Yes, I've been a bad guy, been higher than the blue sky
And the truth is I don't wanna die an ordinary man
I've made mama cry, don't know why I'm still alive
Yes, the truth is I don't wanna die an ordinary man12Embed
