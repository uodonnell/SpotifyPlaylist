Letting Go (Dutty Love) Lyrics
Ayo Sean, you Mr. Kingston

Dutty, dutty, dutty, love, love
I'm feeling like you letting go (Let's go)
Dutty, dutty, dutty, love, love
I'm feeling like you letting go (Uh huh)
Dutty, dutty, dutty, love, love
I'm feeling like you letting go (Young Money)
Dutty, dutty, dutty, love, love

Don't be scared girl, call on me
'Cause me I want you for my eyes I'm a lover, you see
And the way you a wine and the way you a gwan
Said no matter how much I feel rushed, I will not stop
Yo, but baby girl will you be mine?
Let go, show your skin because you're one of a kind
Mi nah  gon lie, girl I must be in love
'Cause the way you are grindin' off my car top

Dutty, dutty, dutty, love, love
I'm feeling like you letting go
Dutty, dutty, dutty, love, love
I'm feeling like you letting go
Dutty, dutty, dutty, love, love
I'm feeling like you letting go
Dutty, dutty, dutty, love, love
Wow!
What if you would just come right out of these clothes?
You can finally feel the wind when it blows
Don't be scared to be free to let go, show it off
Feel like letting go (Let's go)
Oh, oh, oh, oh

I'm here and and you might not like
'Cause you need Sean King inna your life
King I'm a man and a man can't change
And if I come over there I'll lock up with them lips
Yo, I feel like letting go
If you never know, baby now you know
'Cause You're one of a kind, and you dress so fine
Like my diamond chain, you shine so bright, oh

Dutty, dutty, dutty love, love
I'm feeling like you letting go
Dutty, dutty, dutty love, love
I'm feeling like you letting go
Dutty, dutty, dutty love, love
I'm feeling like you letting go
Dutty, dutty, dutty love, love (Let's go)
Woow!
What if you would just come right out of these clothes?
You can finally feel the wind when it blows (Feel it)
Don't be scared to be free, to let go, show it off (Ooh no)
Feel like letting go
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Ayo Sean, You Mr. Kingston
You say you have it, Louie it, and then some
Look how you gwan in all your ice
You pretty and you nice
Yuh done know seh Nicki a yuh wife
But you say I be up where you stay
I ain't like them other bitches that be actin' loosely
Know you gettin' hyper, I know you wanna get up in it
But I just want to think about it for another minute
I think I like your style, wile
Why don't we let go?
Ayo, and I ain't gotta tell 'em
And I ain't gotta sell 'em
It's YSL daddy, I ain't gotta spell it
And yes, I killa kill 'em
I guess I am the villain
I park on the curb, I'm the owner of the building, the building
Ya deaf? Boy mi soon left
Come get this playboy bunny like Hugh Heph
Rastafari
Dutty, dutty, d-d-d-dutty
Oh yeah!
What if you would just come right out of these clothes? (Oh yeah!)
You can finally feel the wind when it blows (Feel it)
Don't be scared to be free, to let go, show it off (Show it off)
Feel like letting go
Oh, oh, oh, oh (Uh huh)
Feel like letting go
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Feel like letting go (Letting)
Oh, oh, oh, oh27Embed
