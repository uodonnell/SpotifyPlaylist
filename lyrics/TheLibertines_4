Youâ€™re My Waterloo Lyrics
You'll never fumigate the demons
No matter how much you smoke
So just say you love me
For three good reasons
And I'll throw you the rope
You don't need it
Because you are the survivor
Of more than one life
And you're the only lover I had
Who ever slept with a knife
But you're not Judy Garland
Oh just like me you've never really had a home of your own
But I'm not Tony Hancock baby
Until the dawn
We'll stone the crows
We'll stone the crows
We'll stone the crows
And you see I've brought you flowers
I've brought you flowers, all collected from the Old Vic Stage
Well I've been sitting here for hours, baby
Just chasing these words
Across the page
Cause you're my Waterloo
Well I'll be your Gypsy Lane
I'm so glad we know just what to do
And exactly who's to blame
And you're my Waterloo
I'll be your Stanley Park
Well I'm so glad we know just what to do
And no one's left
Stumbling around
Fumbling around
Tumbling around
In the dark
Always in the dark
You're my Waterloo
I'll be your Calvary
Well I'm so glad we know just what to do
And everyone's gonna be happy
Everyone's gonna be happy
Everyone's gonna be happy
But of course3Embed
