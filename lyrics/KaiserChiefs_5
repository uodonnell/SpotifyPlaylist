Record Collection Lyrics
I'm a record collection, a dedicated section
I'm a memory of everything you've ever seen and ever done
I'm a subtle seduction, I am out of corruption
I'm a God enlightened, cleaned up, heightened reenactment of your day
I'm a hidden agenda, hidden in a credenza
In the darkest corner of the room inside the room inside your head
Uh-huh, inside your head
Inside your head, inside your head, uh

Sit back and relapse into the world we built for you
Where everything you'll need is on its way now
Make yourself at home, my extraordinary friend
Where everything is okay in the end

Thinking of a number
Whispered in our gun
Trouble hidden, pass it on
Zero, zero, zero, one
Play us one more number
Give us one more song
Tell us one we've heard before
Zero, zero, zero, more
Architecturally speaking, 50 gram is a weakling
I'm a city planner with a stammer who cut down New York, New York
From the tip of a rhino, fuck it if I know
I'm the unexpected, twist your endless laundry list of heinous crimes
Take a vital suggestion, rig an election
I'm the hidden top line of the tune that's on a loop inside your mind
Uh-huh, inside your mind
Inside your mind, inside your mind, uh

Sit back and relapse into the world we built for you
Where everything you'll need is on its way now
Make yourself at home, my extraordinary friend
Where everything is okay in the end

Thinking of a number
Whispered in our gun
Trouble hidden, pass it on
Zero, zero, zero, one
Play us one more number
Give us one more song
Tell us one we've heard before
Zero, zero, zero, more
On an endless corridor behind each hidden door
Infinity at one more never-ending bidding war
Send us your details, my extraordinary friend
Everything is okay if you

Sit back and relapse into the world we built for you
Where everything you'll need is on its way now
Make yourself at home, my extraordinary friend
Where everything is okay in the endEmbed
