Itâ€™s My Life Lyrics
This ain't a song for the broken-hearted (woah oh, woah oh, oh)
No silent prayer for the faith-departed
I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd
You're gonna hear my voice when I shout it out loud

It's my life, it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life) My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"
I just wanna live while I'm alive
It's my life

This is for the ones who stood their ground
For Tommy and Gina who never backed down
Tomorrow's getting harder make no mistake
Luck ain't even lucky, got to make your own breaks

It's my life, it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life) My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"
I just wanna live while I'm alive
'Cause it's my life
Better stand tall when they're calling you out
Don't bend, don't break, baby, don't back down

It's my life, it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life) My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"
I just wanna live while I'm alive
It's my life
And it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life) My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"
I just wanna live while I'm alive
It's my life40Embed
