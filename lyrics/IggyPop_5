Gold Lyrics
It's okay, it's alright
The promise of the tongue
Leaving them behind tonight
But I guess this time, I'm doubled up
I'm doubled down again
I got no time to turn it around again

Hail to the thief
And you won't get nothing much
Hail to the thief
And we'll keep what's left tonight

A little faith, too little pride
Will we ever get it right?
Keep looking for a sign tonight
But I guess it's time, I'm doubled up
And doubled down again
Got no time to turn it around again

Hail to the thief
And you won't get nothing much
Hail to the thief
And we'll keep what's left tonight
Hail to the thief
And you won't get left in line
Hail to the thief
And we'll keep what's left tonightEmbed
