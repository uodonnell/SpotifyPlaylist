You & I (Nobody in the World) Lyrics
I... Yeah

You fix your make-up, just so
Guess you don't know, that you're beautiful
Try on every dress that you own
You were fine in my eyes a half hour ago

And if your mirror won't make it any clearer
I'll be the one to let you know

Out of all the girls
You're my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight
All of the stars
You make them shine like they were ours
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
Ain't nobody in the world but you

You stop the room when we walk in
The spotlight's on, everybody's staring
Tell all of these boys they're wasting their time
Stop standing in line, 'cause you're all mine
And this evening I won't let the feeling die
I never wanna leave your side

Out of all the girls
You’re my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight
All of the stars
You make them shine like they were ours
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
Ain't nobody in the world

You keep wondering if you're what I'm wanting
You don't even have to try
Oh, you don't have to try
Don't try, don't try
You don't have to try

Oh, out of all the girls
You’re my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight
All of the stars
They don't shine brighter than you are
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
You and I
Nobody in the world tonight
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I110Embed
