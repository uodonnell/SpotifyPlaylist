Loverâ€™s Spit Lyrics
All these people drinking lover's spit
They sit around and clean their face with it
And they listen to teeth to learn how to quit
Tied to a night they never met
You know it's time that we grow old and do some shit
I like it all that way
I like it all that way

All these people drinking lover's spit
Swallowing words while giving head
They listen to teeth to learn how to quit
Take some hands and get used to it

All those people drinking lover's spit
They sit around and clean their face with it
You know it's time that we grow old and do some shit
I like it all that way
I like it all that way
I like it all that way4Embed
