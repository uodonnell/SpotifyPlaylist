Missing You Lyrics
I heard that you've been self-medicating
In the quiet of your room
Your sweet suburban tomb
And if you need a friend
I'll help you stitch up your wounds

I've heard that you've been having some trouble
Finding your place in the world
I know how much that hurts
But if you need a friend
Then please, just say the word

You've come this far
You're all cleaned up
You've made a mess again
There's no more trying
It's time to sort yourself out

Hold on tight
This ride is a wild one
Make no mistake, the day will come
When you can't cover up what you've done
Now don't lose your fight, kid
It only takes a little push to pull on through
With so much left to do
You'll be missing out
And we'll be missing you
Come on!
I've heard that you've been having some trouble
Finding your place in the world
I know how much that hurts
And if you need a friend
Then please, just say the word

You've come this far
You're all cleaned up
You've made a mess again
There's no more trying
It's time to sort yourself out

Hold on tight
This ride is a wild one
Make no mistake, the day will come
When you can't cover up what you've done
Now don't lose your fight, kid
It only takes a little push to pull on through
With so much left to do
You'll be missing out
And we'll be missing you

Grit your teeth
Pull your hair
Paint the walls black and scream
"Fuck the world! ‘Cause it’s my life, I'm gonna take it back"
And never for a second blame yourself
Hold on tight
This ride is a wild one
Make no mistake, the day will come
When you can't cover up what you've done
(No you can't cover up
1 2 3 4)
Hold on tight
This ride is a wild one
(This ride is a wild one)
Make no mistake, the day will come
When you can't cover up what you've done
Now don't lose your fight, kid
(don't lose your fight, kid)
It only takes a little push to pull on through
(push to pull on through)
With so much left to do
You'll be missing out
And we'll be missing you28Embed
