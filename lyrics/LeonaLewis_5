One More Sleep Lyrics
Snow is falling all around us
My baby's coming home for Christmas
I've been up all night inside my bedroom
He said he'll be with me real soon
So I wait
And I wait
But I've had as much as I can take

'Cause I've got five more nights of sleeping on my own
Four more days until you're coming home
Three more dreams of you and mistletoe
Two more reasons why I love you so
I've got five more nights until you're next to me
Four more days of being lonely
Three more wishes, I can barely breathe
If I can make it to Christmas Eve then it's
One more sleep (one more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep (Can't believe how much I missed us)
One more sleep (One more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep

Now I don't think I can remember
A cold and lonelier December
And I find myself singing at the window
Wondering when you're gonna get back home
So I try
And I try
But there is nothing I can do to pass this time
'Cause I've got five more nights of sleeping on my own
Four more days until you're coming home
Three more dreams of you and mistletoe
Two more reasons why I love you so
I've got five more nights until you're next to me
Four more days of being lonely
Three more wishes, I can barely breathe
If I can make it to Christmas Eve then it's
One more sleep (one more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep (Can't believe how much I missed us)
One more sleep (One more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep

Until we're rocking around the Christmas tree
Until I got you sitting next to me
We got a lot of catching up to do
I just can't take this missing you

Five more nights on my own
Four more days, hmm
Three more dreams, mistletoe
I can't believe I ever let you go, oh
Five more nights of sleeping on my own (Yeah) (On my own)
Four more days until you're coming home (Until you're coming home)
Three more wishes, I can barely breathe
If I can make it to Christmas Eve then it's
One more sleep
One more sleep
One more sleep
One more sleep1Embed
