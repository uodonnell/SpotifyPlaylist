Overkill Lyrics
Only way to feel the noise
Is when it's good and loud
So good I can't believe it
Screaming with the crowd

Don't sweat it, we'll get it back to you
Don't sweat it, we'll get it back to you
Overkill, overkill
Overkill

On your feet you feel the beat
It goes straight to your spine
Shake your head, you must be dead
If it don't make you fly

Don't sweat it, we'll get it back to you
Don't sweat it, we'll get it back to you
Overkill, overkill
Overkill

Know your body's made to move
Ya feel it in your guts
Rock 'n' roll ain't worth the name
If it don't make you strut

Don't sweat it, we'll get it back to you, hey
Don't sweat it, we'll get it back to you
Overkill, overkill
