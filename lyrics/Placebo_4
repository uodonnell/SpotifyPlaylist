Running Up That Hill Lyrics
"If I only could, I'd be running up that hill
If I only could, I'd be running up that hill"

It doesn't hurt me
You want to feel how it feels?
You want to know, know that it doesn't hurt me?
You want to hear about the deal I'm making?
You (be running up that hill)
You and me (be running up that hill)

And if I only could
Make a deal with God
I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building
If I only could, oh

You don't want to hurt me
But see how deep the bullet lies
Unaware that I'm tearing you asunder
There's a thunder in our hearts, baby
So much hate for the ones we love
Tell me, we both matter, don't we?
You (be running up that hill)
You and me (be running up that hill)
You and me won't be unhappy
And if I only could
Make a deal with God
I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building
If I only could, oh

C'mon, baby, c'mon, c'mon darling
Let me steal this moment from you now
C'mon, angel, c'mon, c'mon, darling
Let's exchange the experience, oh

And if I only could
Make a deal with God
And get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
With no problem

If I only could
Make a deal with God
I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
With no problem
(If I only could
Be running up that hill
If I only could
Be running up that hill
If I only could
Be running up that hill
If I only could
Be running up that hill
If I only could
Be running up that hill
If I only could
Be running up that hill
If I only could
Be running up that hill)7Embed
