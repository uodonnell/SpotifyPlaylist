I Donâ€™t Care (Radio Edit) LyricsI try to make it through my life, in my way, there's you
I try to make it through these lies, and that's all, I do
Just don't deny it
Don't try to fight this, and deal with it
And that's just part of it
If you were dead or still alive
I don't care, I don't care
Just go and leave this all behind
Cause I swear (I swear), I don't care
I try to make you see my side
Always trying to stay in line
But your eyes see right through
That's all they do
I'm getting buried in this place
I got no room you're in my face
Don't say anything just go away
If you were dead or still alive
I don't care, I don't care
Just go and leave this all behind
Cause I swear (I swear) I don't care

I'm changing everything
Cause you won't be there for me (x2)
If you were dead or still alive
I don't care, I don't care
Just go and and leave this all behind
Cause I swear (I swear) I don't care
If you were dead or still alive
I don't care (I don't care), I don't care (I don't care)
Just go ahead and leave this all behind
I don't care (I swear), I don't care
At all...17Embed
