You Make It Real Lyrics
There's so much craziness surrounding me
So much going on, it gets hard to breathe
When all my faith has gone, you bring it back to me
You make it real for me
When I'm not sure of my priorities
When I've lost sight of where I'm meant to be
Like holy water washing over me
You make it real for me

And I'm running to you baby
You are the only one who saves me
That's why I've been missing you lately
Cause you make it real for me

When my head is strong but my heart is weak
I'm full of arrogance and uncertainty
When I can't find the words
You teach my heart to speak
You make it real for me, yeah

And I'm running to you baby
Cause you are the only one who saves me
That's why I've been missing you lately
Cause you make it real for me
Everybody's talking in words I don't understand
You've got to be the only one who knows just who I am
You're shining in the distance, I hope I can make it through
Cause the only place I want to be
Is right back home with you

I guess there's so much more I have to learn
But if you're here with me, I know which way to turn
You always give me somewhere, somewhere I can run
You make it real for me

And I'm running to you baby
Cause you are the only one who saves me
That's why I've been missing you lately
Cause you make it real for me
You make it real for me4Embed
