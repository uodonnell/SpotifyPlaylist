As Lyrics
(duh-du-du-duh
Duh-du-du-duh...)
As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early May
Just as hate knows love's the cure
You can rest your mind assured
That I'll be loving you always
As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing we'll grow older every day
Just as all is born is new
You know what I say is true
That I'll be loving you always

Until the rainbow burns the stars out of the sky (always)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (hmmm uh, this is gonna be always)
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four (you know it's gonna be always)
Until the day that is the day that I'm no more

Did you know that true love asks for nothing?
Her acceptance is the way we pay (ooooh, baby)
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee?
To last through forever (forever), another day
As today I know I'm living but tomorrow (yeahhhhh)
Could make me the past but that I mustn't fear (cause you're here)
Now I know deep in my mind
The love of me I've felt behind

And I'll be loving you always

Until the rainbow burns the stars out of the sky (loving you)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (been loving you)
Until the dolphins fly and parrots live at sea (loving you)
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream (now ain't that loving you?)
Until the day is night and night becomes the day (allllllllways)
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away (I'll be loving you forever)
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four (alllways)
Until the day that is the day that I'm no more (extended) (yeahhhhh)

Did you know that true love asks for nothing? (true love don't want a thing)
Her acceptance is the way we pay (ohhhhh, baby)
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee?
To last forever (another day)
As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early May
Now I know deep in my mind
The love of me I've left behind
And I'll be loving you always
