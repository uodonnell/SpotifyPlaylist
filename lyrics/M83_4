I Need You Lyrics
Have you ever had the feeling
That we're not alone?
All the calls I’ve been receiving
They are not from home
Going down the dusty roads
We couldn’t see through
I need you

There’s a reading on the wall
Of all the things that I have done
And we’re leaving it all
Run away, take my my hand

Sitting all alone
Just the colors of the world35Embed
