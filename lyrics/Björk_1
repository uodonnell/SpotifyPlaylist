Venus as a Boy Lyrics
His wicked sense of humour
Suggests exciting sex
His fingers, they focus on her
Touches, he's Venus as a boy

He believes in a beauty
He's Venus as a boy
He believes in a beauty
He believes in a beauty
He's Venus as a boy
He believes in a beauty

He's exploring the taste of her
Arousal, so accurate
He sets off the beauty in her
He's Venus, Venus as a boy


He believes in a beauty
He's Venus as a boy
He believes in a beauty
He believes in a beauty
He's Venus as a boy
He believes in a beauty
