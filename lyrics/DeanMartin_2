Thatâ€™s Amore Lyrics
(In Napoli where love is king)
(When boy meets girl)
(Here's what they say)

When the moon hits your eye
Like a big pizza pie, that's amore
When the world seems to shine
Like you've had too much wine, that's amore

Bells will ring, ting-a-ling-a-ling
Ting-a-ling-a-ling and you'll sing, "Vita bella"
Hearts will play tippy-tippy-tay
Tippy-tippy-tay like a gay tarantella

When the stars make you drool
Just like a pasta e fasule, that's amore
When you dance down the street
With a cloud at your feet, you're in love
When you walk in a dream
But you know, you're not dreaming, signore
Scusami, but you see
Back in old Napoli, that's amore
(When the moon hits your eye)
(Like a big pizza pie, that's amore) That's amore
(When the world seems to shine)
(Like you've had too much wine, that's amore) That's amore

(Bells will ring ting-a-ling-a-ling)
(Ting-a-ling-a-ling and you'll sing, "Vita bella, vita bella, vita bella")
(Hearts will play tippy-tippy-tay)
(Tippy-tippy-tay like a gay tarantella) Lucky fella

When the stars make you drool
Just like a pasta e fasule, that's amore (That's amore)
When you dance down the street
With a cloud at your feet, you're in love
When you walk in a dream
But you know, you're not dreaming, signore
Scusami, but you see
Back in old Napoli, that's amore
