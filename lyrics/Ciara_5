Level Up Lyrics
Five, four, three, two, one, watch me (Leggo)
Level up, level up, level up, level up, level up
Level up, level up, level up, level up, level up
All this on me so yummy, all this so, so yummy
Know you want this yummy, yummy all in your tummy
Level up, level up, level up, level up, level up
Level up, level up, level up, level up, level up
All this on me so yummy, all this so, so yummy
Know you want this yummy, yummy all in your tummy

Them old mistakes are gone, I won't do them no more
That's old news, there's new news, I done did that before
I turned nothing to something, my comeback on one hunnid
Less talking, more action, you just gon' see Ci coming
I just keep elevating, no losses, just upgrading
My lessons, made blessings, I turned that into money
Thank God I never settled, this view is so much better
I'm chilling, I'm winning, like on another level

Oh, you can talk all you want
See me, I stay prayed up
Nothing I'm afraid of
And I can have it all
Five, four, three, two, one, watch me (Leggo)
Level up, level up, level up, level up, level up
Level up, level up, level up, level up, level up
All this on me so yummy, all this so, so yummy
Know you want this yummy, yummy all in your tummy
Level up, level up, level up, level up, level up
Level up, level up, level up, level up, level up
All this on me so yummy, all this so, so yummy
Know you want this yummy, yummy all in your tummy

Fake friends get dropped like weight (Oh)
Team love, don't want no hate (Nope)
I'm grindin' (Oh), I'm shinin' (Oh)
Up, up, up on my way (Ayy)
Thank God I never settled (Nope)
This view is so much better
I'm chilling, I'm winning, like on another level

Oh, you can talk all you want
See me, I stay prayed up
Nothing I'm afraid of
And I can have it all
Five, four, three, two, one, watch me (Leggo)
Level up, level up, level up, level up, level up
Level up, level up, level up, level up, level up
All this on me so yummy, all this so, so yummy
Know you want this yummy, yummy all in your tummy
Level up, level up, level up, level up, level up
Level up, level up, level up, level up, level up
All this on me so yummy, all this so, so yummy
Know you want this yummy, yummy all in your tummy

All this so, so level, on another level
Elevate your level, le-le-le-level
Graduate your level, there's no one on it
Nah, nah, nah, ayy
All this so, so level, on another level
Elevate your level, le-le-le-level
Graduate your level, there's no one on it
Nah, nah, nah, ayy

Level up, level up, level up, level up, level up
Level up, level up, level up, level up, level up
All this on me so yummy, all this so, so yummy
Know you want this yummy, yummy all in your tummy
Level up, level up, level up, level up, level up
Level up, level up, level up, level up, level up
All this on me so yummy, all this so, so yummy
Know you want this yummy, yummy all in your tummy (Uh)10Embed
