I Wonâ€™t Let You Go Lyrics
When it's black
Take a little time to hold yourself
Take a little time to feel around
Before it's gone
You won't let go
But you still keep on falling down
Remember how you saved me now
From all of my wrongs, yeah

If there's love, just feel it
And If there's life, we'll see it
This is no time to be alone, alone, yeah
I won't let you go

Say those words
Say those words like there's nothing else
Close your eyes and you might believe
That there is some way out, yeah
Open up
Open up your heart to me now
Let it all come pouring out
There's nothing I can't take
If there's love, just feel it
And if there's life, we'll see it
This is no time to be alone, alone, yeah
I won't let you go (won't let you go, won't let you go)
If your sky is falling
Just take my hand and hold it
You don't have to be alone, alone, yeah
I won't let you go (won't let you go, won't let you go)

And if you feel the fading of the light
And you're too weak to carry on the fight
And all your friends that you count on have disappeared
I'll be here, not gone, forever, holding on, oh

If there's love, just feel it
And if there's life, we'll see it
This is no time to be alone, alone, yeah
I won't let you go
If your sky is falling
Just take my hand and hold it
You don't have to be alone, alone, yeah
I won't let you go
I won't let you go, I won't let
I won't let you go, I won't let
I won't let you go
I won't let you go1Embed
