Monophobia Lyrics
Inside my head, there's a little place left for you
What do you know?
What do you know?
And all I want is to find out what you're going through
What do I know?
Maybe this silence is dangerous

Inside my head, there's a little place left for you
What do you know?
What do you know?
And feel what's inside you
I wanna come over
And see what you've found
See if you're hurting
After tearing me down
It's the rain of denial

It's the way that you're faking
All the tears in your eyes
Feels like I'm in slow motion
Tonight
And all I want is to find out what you're going through
What do I know?
Maybe this silence is dangerous
I wanted to hide
Now, I just wanna find you
And feel what's inside you
I wanna come over
And see what you've found
See if you're hurting
After tearing me down
It's the rain of denial11Embed
