Restless Lyrics
People wonder, people talk
We're supposed to settle down
How we ever got this far
Without our feet touching the ground
What time is it now where you are?
We follow beats with different drums
We're looking at the same star
It is a talent staying young

So why you think we both
Run around in circles
Walk through fire
Nothing hurts us

Every mountain you climb takes you further away
Overcome a lifetime, every day
No, we can't help it
We're always restless
Now you're wired then you're tired
There is never a break
You only come alive at the thrill of the chase
No, we can't help it
We're always restless
Try to keep it all up in the air
You ruin it when you ask why
You know it's not that I don't care
I don't get jealous, I get free
Everything good comes back to me
It seems like wherever you are
Is just a better place to be

So why you think we both
Run around in circles
Will you meet me
In the middle?

Every mountain you climb takes you further away
Overcome a lifetime, every day
No, we can't help it
We're always restless
Now you're wired then you're tired
There is never a break
You only come alive at the thrill of the chase
No, we can't help it
We're always restless
We already know the ending
When the credits roll down slow
I'll hurry back
I'll hurry back
I'll hurry back
To you

Every mountain you climb takes you further away
Overcome a lifetime, every day
No, we can't help it
We're always restless
Now you're wired then you're tired
There is never a break
You only come alive at the thrill of the chase
No, we can't help it
We're always restless

I'll hurry back
I'll hurry back
I'll hurry back
(Restless, restless, I feel restless)
I'll hurry back (restless)
I'll hurry (restless) back
(I feel) I'll hurry (restless) back
I feel restless
Restless, restless2Embed
