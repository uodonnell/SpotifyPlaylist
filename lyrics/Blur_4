Beetlebum Lyrics
Beetlebum
What you done?
She's a gun
Now what you done
Beetlebum?
Get nothing done
You beetlebum
Just get numb
Now what you done
Beetlebum?

And when she lets me slip away
She turns me on and all my violence gone
Nothing is wrong
I just slip away and I am gone
Nothing is wrong
She turns me on
I just slip away and I am gone

Beetlebum
Because you're young
She's a gun
Now what you done
Beetlebum?
She'll suck your thumb
She'll make you cum
'Cause she's your gun
Now what you done
Beetlebum?
And when she lets me slip away
She turns me on and all my violence gone
Nothing is wrong
I just slip away and I am gone
There's nothing wrong
She turns me on
I just slip away and I am gone

He's on, he's on, he's on it
He's on, he's on, he's on it
He's on, he's on, he's on it
He's on, he's on, he's on it
He's on, he's on, he's on it
He's on, he's on, he's on it
He's on, he's on, he's on it
He's on, he's on, he's on it17Embed
