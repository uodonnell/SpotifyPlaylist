Turnaround Lyrics
One, two, three, four
Pa-da-da-dip-du-du-dap
Pa-da-da-di-da
Pa-da-da-dip-du-du-dap
Pa-da-da-di-da
Pa-da-da-dip-du-du-dap
Pa-da-doo-di-da

Turn around, I'm right behind you
Turn around, I'll turn around too
Turn around, so we can clap hands
Turn around, it's flight or flutter
Turn around, hot peas and butter
Turn around, I'm fallin' in the grass
Pa-da-dee-du-du

Straight (Straight), how can you be so straight? (Straight)
Life is everything but straight (Straight)
It's going up and down
Far (Far)
Happiness isn't far (Far)
Not far from where you are (Are)
Watching your life go by (By, by by)
Now, why don't you sing out loud?
The tune you keep inside?
Pa-da-da-dip-du-du-dip
Pa-da-da-du-da
Pa-da-da-dip-du-du-dip
Ta-da-da-du-da
Pa-da-da-dip-du-du-dup
Tu-rup-pa-da-da-du-di-da

Turnaround, around the circle
Turnaround, just like duetto
Turnaround, and listen to the wind
Turnaround, and put your pen down
Turnaround, your feet off the ground
Turnaround, and your head in the clouds

Shy (Shy)
How can you be so shy? (Shy)
Hiding below the stars (Stars)
Under your neon light (Light)
Hi (Hi)
Don't say hello, say hi (Hi)
Hi to a higher sky (Sky)
Hi to a higher ground
Loud, why don't you sing out loud?
The words you keep inside?
Pa-da-da-dip-du-du-dap-du
Ta-da-da-du-da
Pa-da-da-dip-du-du-da-du
Ba-da-da-du-da
Pa-da-da-dip-du-du-da-du
Ba-da-da-du-da
Pa-da-da-dip-du-du-da-du
Ba-da-da-du-da
Pa-da-da-dip-du-du-da-du
Ba-da-da-du-da
Pa-da-da-dip-du-du-da-du
Ba-da-da-di-da
Pa-da-da-dip-du-du-da-du
Ba-da-da-di-da
Pa-da-da-dip-du-du-da

Why don't you sing it out loud?
Why don't you sing out loud? (Why don't you sing out loud what you sing out loud?)
The song you keep inside?1Embed
