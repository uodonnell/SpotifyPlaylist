What If This Is All the Love You Ever Get? Lyrics
Woah woah, what if this is all the love you ever get?
Woah woah, you'd do a couple things so differently, I bet
Woah woah, what if this is all the love I ever know
Woah woah, I'd say the words that were so hard to say: don't go

So you've fallen in love
So you've fallen apart

What if it hurts like hell
Then it'll hurt like hell
Come on over, come on over here
I'm in the ruins too
I know the wreckage so well
Come on over, come on over here

Woah woah, what if this is all the love you ever get?
Woah woah, you'd not worry so much about counting your regrets
Woah woah, what if this is all the love I'm ever shown
Woah woah, I'd not be so scared to run into the unknown

So you've fallen in love
So you've fallen apart
What if it hurts like hell
Then it'll hurt like hell
Come on over, come on over here
I'm in the ruins too
I know the wreckage so well
Come on over, come on over here

What if this is all the love you ever get?
What if this is all the love you ever get
What if this is all the love you ever get?
What if this is all the love you ever get?3Embed
