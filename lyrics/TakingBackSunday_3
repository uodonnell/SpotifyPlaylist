Youâ€™re So Last Summer Lyrics
She said
"Don't, don't let it go to your head
Boys like you are a dime a dozen
Boys like you are a dime a dozen"
She said
"You're a touch overrated
You're a lush and I hate it
But these grass stains on my knees
They won't mean a thing"

And all I need to know
Is that I'm something you'll be missing
(Is that I'm something that you're missing)
Maybe I should hate you for this
(Maybe I should hate you for this)
Never really did ever quite get that far
Maybe I should hate you for this
(Maybe I should hate you for this)
Never really did ever quite get that

I'd never lie to you, unless I had to
I'll do what I got to
Unless I had to
I'll do what I got to
The truth is you could slit my throat
And with my one last gasping breath
I'd apologize for bleeding on your shirt
And all I need to know
Is that I'm something you'll be missing
(Is that I'm something that you're missing)
Maybe I should hate you for this
(Maybe I should hate you for this)
Never really did ever quite get that far
Maybe I should hate you for this
(Maybe I should hate you for this)
Never really did ever quite get that

'Cause I'm a wishful thinker with the worst intentions
This will be the last chance you get to drop my name
'Cause I'm a wishful thinker with the worst intentions
This will be the last chance you get to drop my name
If I'm just bad news, then you're a liar
(Maybe I should hate you for this)
If I'm just bad news, then you're a liar
If I'm just bad news, then you're a liar
(Maybe I should hate you for this)
If I'm just bad news, then you're a liar
If I'm just bad news, then you're a liar
(Maybe I should hate you for this)
If I'm just bad news, then you're a liar
If I'm just bad news, then you're a liar
(Maybe I should hate you for this)
If I'm just bad news, then you're a liar
If I'm just bad news, then you're a liar
If I'm just bad news, then you're a liar
Maybe I should hate you for this
(If only you knew half as much as you pretend to)
Maybe I should hate you for this
(If only you knew half as much as you pretend to)11Embed
