Accidentally in Love Lyrics
So, she said, "What's the problem, baby?"
What's the problem? I don't know
Well, maybe I'm in love (Love)
Think about it
Every time I think about it
Can't stop thinking 'bout it
How much longer will it take to cure this?
Just to cure it, 'cause I can't ignore it if it's love (Love)
Makes me wanna turn around and face me
But I don't know nothin' 'bout love, uh

Come on, come on
Turn a little faster
Come on, come on
The world will follow after
Come on, come on
Because everybody's after love

So I said, I'm a snowball runnin'
Runnin' down into the spring that's comin'
All this love meltin' under blue skies
Belting out sunlight, shimmering love
Well, baby, I surrender
To this strawberry ice cream
Never-ever-ender
All this love
Well, I didn't mean to do it
But there's no escaping your love, oh
These lines of lightnin' mean we're never alone
Never alone
No, no

Come on, come on
Move a little closer
Come on, come on
I wanna hear you whisper
Come on, come on
Settle down inside my love, ohh
Come on, come on
Jump a little higher
Come on, come on
If you feel a little lighter
Come on, come on
We were once upon a time in love

We're accidentally in love, accidentally in love
Accidentally in love, accidentally in love
Accidentally in love, accidentally in love
Accidentally in love, accidentally in love
Accidentally, I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
Accidentally, I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
Accidentally

Come on, come on (Come on)
Spin a little tighter
Come on, come on (Come on)
And the world's a little brighter
Come on, come on (Come on)
Just get yourself inside her love
I'm in love23Embed
