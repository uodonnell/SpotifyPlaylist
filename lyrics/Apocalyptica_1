Not Strong Enough Lyrics
I'm not strong enough to stay away
Can't run from you, I just run back to you
Like a moth, I'm drawn in to your flame
Say my name, but it's not the same
You look in my eyes
I'm stripped of my pride
And my soul surrenders
And you bring my heart to its knees

And it's killin' me when you're away
And I wanna leave and I wanna stay
I'm so confused, so hard to choose
Between the pleasure and the pain
And I know it's wrong, and I know it's right
Even if I try to win the fight
My heart would overrule my mind
And I'm not strong enough to stay away

I'm not strong enough to stay away
What can I do? I would die without you
In your presence, my heart knows no shame
I'm not to blame, cause you bring my heart to its knees
And it's killin' me when you're away
And I wanna leave and I wanna stay
I'm so confused, so hard to choose
Between the pleasure and the pain
And I know it's wrong, and I know it's right
Even if I try to win the fight
My heart would overrule my mind
And I'm not strong enough to stay away

There's nothing I can do
My heart is chained to you
And I can't get free
Look what this love did to me

And it's killin' me when you're away
And I wanna leave and I wanna stay
I'm so confused, so hard to choose
Between the pleasure and the pain
And I know it's wrong, and I know it's right
Even if I try to win the fight
My heart would overrule my mind
And I'm not strong enough to stay away
Not strong enough, strong enough
Not strong enough, strong enough to stay away
Not strong enough, strong enough
Not strong enough, strong enough
And I'm not strong enough to stay away2Embed
