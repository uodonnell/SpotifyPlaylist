Everybody, yeah
Rock your body, yeah
Everybody, yeah
Rock your body right
Backstreet's back, alright!

Hey-yeah, oh
Oh my God, we're back again
Brothers, sisters, everybody sing
Gonna bring the flavor, show you how
Got a question for you, better answer now, yeah

Am I original? Yeah
Am I the only one? Yeah
Am I sexual? Yeah
Am I everything you need?
You better rock your body now

Everybody yeah (yeah)

Wave them around like you just don't care
If you wanna party, let me hear you yell
'Cause we got it goin' on again (yeah-yeah-eh!)
