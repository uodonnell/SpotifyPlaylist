Green Aphrodisiac Lyrics
Laying in the grass in the afternoon
Something kind of magical in sunlight
Flowers uncurl in the garden
Shoots are coming up again, it's springtime

It's new like the day I saw your eyes
Green like the leaves unfurling up against a blue sky
Blossom leaf falls in a slow dance
Swaying got me in a trance, so high
It's all green, all new, and I want to spend it with you

Lost in your wonderland
Green aphrodisiac
Kiss me, your lips taste of honey
Songbirds and bees start a-hummin'
Come to my wonderland
Green aphrodisiac
The same thing that grows in the garden
Flows in me and you

I want to go where all the rainbows start and flow
Just when I thought it was not to be
Holiest of mysteries, it's all green
And everything that I have planted has grown
And all it needed was time, earth, water, and the sunlight
Down to the middle

Lost in your wonderland
Green aphrodisiac
Kiss me, your lips taste of honey
Songbirds and bees start a-hummin'
Come to my wonderland
Green aphrodisiac
The same thing that grows in the garden
Flows in me and you

I want to go where all the rainbows start and flow
How could I know it was Sunday?
How could I know you would take over my mind?
I want to know where all the flowers unfold
Cause I know that
The same thing grows in the garden, flows in me and you

Aphrodisiac, green aphrodisiac
I want to go with you
Where it's green and all the flowers grow
All the water flows, all the memories go
Just for the afternoon, ooh baby
Aphrodisiac, green aphrodisiac
Kiss me your lips taste of honey
Songbirds and bees start hummin'
Oh, out to the garden
I'm, I'm foolin' around with you, oh, oh
I want you there
When I get out
And the grass is wet and the lilac is in the air again

You (na na na na na)
Oh (na na na na na)
Oh, ah-ah (na na na na na)
Oh, oh, oh, oh (na na na na na)
(Na na na na na)
(Na na na na na)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
(Na na na na na)
(Na na na na na)
(Na na na na na)
(Na na na na na)
(Na na na na na)Embed
