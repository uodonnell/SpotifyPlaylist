How Come Lyrics
So I changed, huh?
You got a phone
Pick it up, call me

How come we don't even talk no more?
And you don't even call no more?
We don't barely keep in touch at all
And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grapevine, we even beefing now
After all the years we've been down
Ain't no way, no how, this bullshit can't be true
We family, ain't a damn thing changed, unless it's you

We were so young, so full of life and vibrance
Side by side, wherever you was riding, I went
So close, almost on some Bonnie and Clyde shit
When Ronnie died, you was right by my side
With a shoulder to cry on and tissue to wipe my eyes
And a bucket to catch every tear I cried inside it
You even had the same type of childhood I did
Sometimes I just wanna know why is it
That you succame to yours and mine, I survived it
You ran the streets, I nine-to-fived it
We grew up, grew apart as time went by us
Then I blew up, to both yours and mines surprises
Now I feel a vibe, I just can't describe it
Much as your pride tries to hide it
You're cold, your touch is just like ice
And your eyes is a look of resentment
I can sense it and I don't like it
How come we don't even talk no more?
And you don't even call no more?
We don't barely keep in touch at all
And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grapevine, we even beefing now
After all the years we've been down
Ain't no way, no how, this bullshit can't be true
We family, ain't a damn thing changed, unless it's you

It was my dream at first to be off spitting a verse
On my own album with a deal, but shit got worse
'Fore I came out, I woulda killed a nigga first
'Fore I let him disrespect me, or check me over some worrisome
Bitch that I wasn't with, I woulda hit it and quit
But you were planning to talk with her and tell her she was the shit
I told you don't get involved with her
You would smoke in the car with her
Coming out of the bar with her, stumbling, half-drunk
Like y'all was husband and wife or something
But me catching her fuckin' other niggas
Must've hurt your pride or something
'Cause you woof off at the mouth to people
Like you want it with me
When all I tried to do was show you that your bitch was shifty
And ever since the fans and all the shit that I produced
You acting like I ain't your mans and lying like she can't be loose
But I am really your friend, I'm just trying to tell you the truth
Don't hate the game or the player, the one that's changing is you
How come we don't even talk no more?
And you don't even call no more?
We don't barely keep in touch at all
And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grapevine, we even beefing now
After all the years we've been down
Ain't no way, no how, this bullshit can't be true
We family, ain't a damn thing changed, unless it's you

It gets lonely at the top 'cause my homie had to stop
Now we acting like I gotta live only for the block
And homies in the hood only see me on the tube
So they gossip on the porch, get to speaking all rude
Fools I used to rap with all expect magic
Like my finger get to snapping and poof, it just happen
But Proof is just acting out the part he was thrown
Shady made it so my babies ain't starving at home
See the devil in your glance, since the ghetto, we been friends
Forever real intelligence, that's forever till the end
I peep the hatreds in your eyes and the Satan in your lies
Ain't wasting my time with these snakes in disguise
How come when you talk, it's with bitter and spite?
And how come it was my fault for what you did with your life?
And every time I go to hear you and play, you look away
We barely embrace, you can't even look me in my face
How come we don't even talk no more?
And you don't even call no more?
We don't barely keep in touch at all
And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grapevine, we even beefing now
After all the years we've been down
Ain't no way, no how, this bullshit can't be true
We family, ain't a damn thing changed, unless it's you21Embed
