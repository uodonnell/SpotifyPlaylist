Buttons Lyrics
I'm telling you to loosen up my buttons, babe (Uh-huh!)
But you keep fronting, uh
Sayin' what you gon' to do to me (Uh-huh!)
But I ain't seen nothing
I'm telling you to loosen up my buttons, babe (Uh-huh!)
But you keep fronting, uh
Sayin' what you gon' to do to me (Uh-huh!)
But I ain't seen nothing

Typical ain't hardly the type I fall for
I like when the physical
Don't leave me asking for more
I'm a sexy mama (Mama)
Who knows just how to get what I wanna (Wanna)
What I wanna do is spring this on ya (On ya)
Back up all of the things that I told ya (Told ya, told ya, told ya)
You been sayin' all the right things all night long
But I can't seem to get you over here to help take this off

Baby, can't you see (See)
How these clothes are fitting on me (Me)
And the heat coming from this beat? (Beat)
I'm about to blow, I don't think you know
I'm telling you to loosen up my buttons, babe (Uh-huh!)
But you keep fronting, uh
Sayin' what you gon' to do to me (Uh-huh!)
But I ain't seen nothing
I'm telling you to loosen up my buttons, babe (Uh-huh!)
But you keep fronting, uh
Sayin' what you gon' to do to me (Uh-huh!)
But I ain't seen nothing

You say you're a big boy, but I can't agree
'Cause the love you said you had ain't been put on me
I wonder (Wonder) if I'm just too much for you
Wonder (Wonder) if my kiss don't make you just
Wonder (Wonder), what I got next for you
What you wanna do? (Do)
Take the chance to recognize that this could be yours
I can see just like most guys that your game don't please

Baby, can't you see (See)
How these clothes are fitting on me (Me)
And the heat coming from this beat? (Beat)
I'm about to blow, I don't think you know
I'm telling you to loosen up my buttons, babe (Uh-huh!)
But you keep fronting, uh
Sayin' what you gon' to do to me (Uh-huh!)
But I ain't seen nothing
I'm telling you to loosen up my buttons, babe (Uh-huh!)
But you keep fronting, uh
Sayin' what you gon' to do to me (Uh-huh!)
But I ain't seen nothing

Come on, baby, loosen up my buttons, babe
Loosen up my buttons, babe
Baby, won't you loosen up my buttons, babe?
Loosen up my buttons, babe
Come on, baby, loosen up my buttons, babe
Loosen up my buttons, babe
Baby, won't you loosen up my buttons, babe?
Loosen up my buttons, babe

I'm telling you to loosen up my buttons, babe (Uh-huh!)
But you keep fronting, uh
Sayin' what you gon' to do to me (Uh-huh!)
But I ain't seen nothing
I'm telling you to loosen up my buttons, babe (Uh-huh!)
But you keep fronting, uh
Sayin' what you gon' to do to me (Uh-huh!)
But I ain't seen nothing
I'm telling you to loosen up my buttons, babe (Uh-huh!)
But you keep fronting, uh
Sayin' what you gon' to do to me (Uh-huh!)
But I ain't seen nothing
I'm telling you to loosen up my buttons, babe (Uh-huh!)
But you keep fronting, uh
Sayin' what you gon' to do to me (Uh-huh!)
But I ain't seen nothing1Embed
