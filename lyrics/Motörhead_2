Heroes (David Bowie cover) Lyrics
I, I will be king
And you, shall be my queen
Though nothing, will never drive them away
But we can beat them, forever and ever
Cause we can be heroes, just for one day

And you, you are insane
And I, I am the same
Cause we're lovers, and that is the truth
Yes we're lovers, and we are the proof

Though nothing, will keep us together
We could stop time, forever and ever
We can be heroes
What d'you say?

I, I can remember (I remember)
Standing, by the wall (by the wall)
And the guns, were all ready to fire (ready to fire)
And we kissed, as though we never can fall (never can fall)

And the shame, was on another city
Oh we can beat them, forever and ever
Then we could be heroes, just for one day
We can be heroes, we can be heroes
We can be heroes, just for one day
We can be heroesEmbed
