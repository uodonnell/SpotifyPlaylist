Madness Lyrics
Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma mad mad mad
Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma mad mad mad
Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma mad mad mad
Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma mad mad mad

I, I can't get these memories
Out of my mind
And some kind of madness
Is starting to evolve, mmmm
And I, I tried so hard to let you go
But some kind of madness
Is swallowing me whole, yeah

I have finally seen the light
And I have finally realised
What you mean

Now, I need to know, is this real love
Or is it just madness
Keeping us afloat? Mmm
And when I look back
At all the crazy fights we had
It's like some kind of madness
Was taking control, yeah
Now, I have finally seen the light
And I have finally realised
What you need


Now, I have finally seen the end (finally seen the end)
And I'm not expecting you to care, no (expecting you to care)
That I have finally seen the light (finally seen the light)
And I have finally realized (realized)
I need your love
I need your love

Come to me
Just in a dream
Come on and rescue me
Yes I know
I can't be wrong
Baby, you're too headstrong
Our love is...

Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma mad mad mad
Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma mad mad mad
Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma mad mad mad
Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma--ma--ma madness...44Embed
