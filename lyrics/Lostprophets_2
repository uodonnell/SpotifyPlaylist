Last Train Home Lyrics
To every broken heart in here
Love was once a part, but now it's disappeared
She told me that it's all part of the choices that you make
Even when you think you're right, you have to give to take

But there's still tomorrow
Forget the sorrow
And I can be on the last train home
Watch it pass the day
As it fades away
No more time to care
No more time today

But we sing
If we're going nowhere
Yeah, we sing
If it's not enough
And we sing
Sing without a reason to ever fall in love

I wonder if you're listening
Picking up on the signals sent back from within
Sometimes it feels like I don't really know what's goin' on
Time and time again it seems like everything is wrong in here
But there's still tomorrow
Forget the sorrow
And I can be on the last train home
Watch it pass the day
As it fades away
No more time to care
No more time today

But we sing
If we're going nowhere
Yeah, we sing
If it's not enough
And we sing
Sing without a reason to ever fall in love

But we sing if we're going nowhere
Yeah, we sing if it's not enough
And we sing
Sing without a reason to ever fall in love

But we sing
If we're going nowhere
Yeah, we sing
If it's not enough
And we sing
Sing without a reason to never fall in love
To never fall in love again
(To never fall in love again)
(To never fall in love again)3Embed
