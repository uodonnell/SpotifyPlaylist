Soulmate Lyrics
Incompatible, it don’t matter though
'Cause someone’s bound to hear my cry
Speak out if you do, you’re not easy to find

Is it possible, Mr. Lovable
Is already in my life?
Right in front of me
Or maybe you’re in disguise

Who doesn’t long for someone to hold?
Who knows how to love you, without being told
Somebody tell me, why I’m on my own
If there’s a soulmate for everyone
Oh, yeah yeah

Here we are again, circles never end
How do I find the perfect fit?
There’s enough for everyone
But I’m still waiting in line

Who doesn’t long for someone to hold?
Who knows how to love you, without being told
Somebody tell me, why I’m on my own
If there’s a soulmate for everyone
If there’s a soulmate for everyone
Most relationships seem so transitory
They’re all good, but not the permanent one

Who doesn’t long for someone to hold?
Who knows how to love you, without being told
Oh, somebody tell me, why I’m on my own
If there’s a soulmate for everyone
Who doesn’t long for someone to hold?
Who knows how to love you, without being told
Somebody tell me, why I’m on my own
If there’s a soulmate for everyone
If there’s a soulmate for everyone3Embed
