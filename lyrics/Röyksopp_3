Sordid Affair Lyrics
There was a time, dark and divine
Exciting and new, shameful and true
Free to explore, we had it all
Towering trust, insatiable lust
Clouding the truth, both of us knew
This sordid affair, is ending in tears
Yes we would go on, knowing the wrong
Until the day, it was taken away

Oh all our love
Fell down to Earth
Here broken and cold
With great remorse

But for a while it all made sense
It might have been just a dark pretence
But you had me, and I loved it
To be with you, to be the one
To live a lie, it really got me all excited
I felt wanted

Then in the night, the sorrow inside
Was taken away, deliverance came
Fell from the sky, Heaven replied
Salvation in streams, silent and clean
Yes, all that we were, all that we knew
Is fading away, like tears in the rain
All that we were, all that we knew
Fading away
All that we were, all that we knew
Fading away
All that we were, all that we knew
Fading away
All that we were, all that we knew
Fading away
All that we were, all that we knew
Fading away...3Embed
