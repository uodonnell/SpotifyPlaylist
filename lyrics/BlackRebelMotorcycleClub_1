Beat the Devil’s Tattoo Lyrics
You have forsaken all the love you’ve taken
Sleeping on a razor, there’s nowhere left to fall
Your body’s aching, every bone is breaking
Nothing seems to shake it, it just keeps holding on
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah

Your soul is able, death is all you cradle
Sleeping on the nails, there’s nowhere left to fall
You have admired, every man desires
Everyone is king when there’s no one left to pawn
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah


There is no peace here, war is never cheap, dear
Love will never meet it, it just gets sold for parts
You cannot fight it, all the world denies it
Open up your eyelids and let your demons run
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah

I thread the needle through, you beat the devil’s tattoo
I thread the needle through, you beat the devil’s tattoo
I thread the needle through, you beat the devil’s tattoo
I thread the needle through, you beat the devil’s tattoo
I thread the needle through, you beat the devil’s tattoo
I thread the needle through, you beat the devil’s tattoo
I thread the needle through, you beat the devil’s tattoo
I thread the needle through, you beat the devil’s tattoo15Embed
