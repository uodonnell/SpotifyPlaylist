Ablaze Lyrics
First thing that you'll notice is some separation from each other
Yes, it's a lie, we've been believing since time immemorial
There was an apple, there was a snake, there was division
There was a split, there was a conflict in the fabric of life

One became two, and then everyone was out for themselves
Everyone was pitted against each other, conflict ruled the realm
All our devotions and temperaments are pulled from different wells
We seem to easily forget we are made of the same cells

To my boy, all that energy, so vital
Love your hues and your blues in equal measure
Your comings and your goings-away
My mission is to keep the light in your eyes ablaze

Second thing you'll notice is that often we think that there's not enough
It might feel dark, it might feel lonely and you'll wonder why you're here
You'll be overcome with darkness and a sense of hopelessness
But it won't matter if you keep the core connected to the oneness

To my girl, all your innocence and fire
When you reach out, I am here hell or high water
This nest is never going away
My mission is to keep the light in your eyes ablaze
And this cord is unbreakable
This pilot light is there in your pocket
And this bond, beyond unshakable
Even if we all forgot, all at the same time
If we forget at the same time

To my boy, my precious, gentle warrior
To your sweetness and your strength in exploring
May this bond stay with you through all your days
My mission is to keep the light in your eyes ablaze

To my girl, all your innocence and fire
When you reach out, I am here hell or high water
This nest is never going away
My mission is to keep the light in your eyes ablaze

To my boy
(First thing that you'll notice is that everything is temporary)
To my girl
(Next that you might know is that we will always be a family)
To my boy
(My mission is to keep the light in your eyes ablaze)3Embed
