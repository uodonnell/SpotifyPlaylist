Hero Lyrics
I'm just a step away, I'm just a breath away
Losin' my faith today, we're fallin' off the edge today
I am just a man, not superhuman
I'm not superhuman, someone save me from the hate
It's just another war, just another family torn
We're falling from my faith today
Just a step from the edge
Just another day in the world we live

I need a hero to save me now!
I need a hero! Save me now!
I need a hero to save my life!
A hero will save me just in time!

I've gotta fight today to live another day
Speakin' my mind today, my voice will be heard today
I've gotta make a stand, but I am just a man
I'm not superhuman, my voice will be heard today
It's just another war, just another family torn
My voice will be heard today
It's just another kill
The countdown begins to destroy ourselves
I need a hero to save me now!
I need a hero! Save me now!
I need a hero to save my life!
A hero will save me just in time!

I need a hero to save my life!
I need a hero just in time!
Save me just in time!
Save me just in time!

Who's gonna fight for what's right?
Who's gonna help us survive?
We're in the fight of our lives
And we're not ready to die
Who's gonna fight for the weak?
Who's gonna make 'em believe?
I've got a hero (I've got a hero) livin' in me!
I've gotta fight for what's right
Today, I'm speakin' my mind
And if it kills me tonight
I will be ready to die
A hero's not afraid to give his life
A hero's gonna save me just in time
I need a hero to save me now!
I need a hero! Save me now!
I need a hero to save my life!
A hero will save me just in time!

I need a hero!
Who's gonna fight for what's right?
Who's gonna help us survive?
I need a hero!
Who's gonna fight for the weak?
Who's gonna make 'em believe?
I've got a hero, I need a hero!
A hero's gonna save me just in time39Embed
