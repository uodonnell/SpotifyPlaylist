Starcrossed Losers Lyrics
It started out as nothing in the strangest sense
He was never in his right mind, no defense
She prayed for his attention, often on repeat
Every time she heard his name and his heartbeat
He was in denial in his own backyard
Pleading for the rain just to come down hard
She bought him a bracelet and put it on his wrist
Like every time before she got close but missed

Romeo, Romeo I'm your Juliet
I'm the pot of gold that you haven't found yet
I'm here, right here
He said, "Juliet I believe every word you say
Time is running backwards every single day
I'm here, right here"

Well it started out as nothing in the strangest place
Beating like a drum in a hard luck space
He swore that he could feel something tugging on his sleeve
He had the strangest sense that he was Adam, she was Eve
She was in chains by her own good hand
Keeping all the angels under her command
He saw every detail burning like sun
Couldn't get it straight that his race was run
Romeo, Romeo tell me where you've been
I would be complete if you'd only let me in
I'm here, right here
He said, "Juliet I told you I was only passing through
If I had a moment I would spend it just with you
I'm here, right here"

And they all fall down
And they all fall down

And she said, "Romeo, Romeo I'm your Juliet
I'm the pot of gold that you haven't found yet
I'm here, right here"
He said, "Juliet I believe every word you say
Time is running backwards every single day
I'm here, right here"
She said, "Romeo, Romeo tell me where you've been
I would be complete if you'd only let me in
I'm here, right here"
And he said, "Juliet I told you I was only passing through
If I had a moment I would spend it just with you
I'm here, right here"1Embed
