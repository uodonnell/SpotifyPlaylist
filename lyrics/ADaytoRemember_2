All I Want Lyrics
I'm always screaming my lungs out, 'til my head starts spinning
Playing my songs is the way I cope with life
Won't keep my voice down
Know the words I speak are the thoughts I think out loud
I like to keep things honest
I'm a safe bet, like your life's staked on it, for real
I'd hate to keep you all wondering
I'm constant, like the seasons, and I will never be forgotten, man

Let's leave no words unspoken and save regrets for the broken
Will you even look back when you think of me?

All I want is a place to call my own
To mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone
Whoa, you know to keep your
Hopes up high and your head down low

Keep your hopes up high and your head down low

Still got something left to prove, it tends to keep things movin'
While everyone around me says my last days are looming
Overhead, but what the hell do they think they know?
My head's above the water, while they drown in the undertow
Let's leave no words unspoken and save regrets for the broken
Will you even look back when you think of me?

All I want is a place to call my own
To mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone
Whoa, you know to keep your
Hopes up high and your head down low
All I want is a place to call my own
To mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone
Whoa, you know to keep your
Hopes up high and your head down low

If you take it from me
Live your life for yourself
'Cause when it's all said and done
You don't need anyone else, c'mon!


So, let's get back to when everything seemed perfect
Not a worry in the world, tell me, was this all worth it?
I get what I want, so, everyone's always judging me
I'm not afraid of anything, I've got the whole world in front of me
All I want is a place to call my own
To mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone
Whoa, you know to keep your
Hopes up high and your head down low
All I want is a place to call my own
To mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone
Whoa, you know to keep your
Hopes up high and your head down low!

Keep your head down low!
Keep your head down low!
Keep your hopes up high and your head down low!23Embed
