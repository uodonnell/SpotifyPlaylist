Rue des cascades LyricsWhen I'm asleep in Cascade Street
When I'm asleep in Cascade Street
I don't, I don't
See anything
When I'm asleep in Cascade Street
When I'm asleep in Cascade Street
I hear, I hear
Nothing, nothing
In the cascade, in the cascade
You washed me
When I wake up in Cascade Street
When I wake up in Cascade Street
I feel nothing
I feel nothing
When I'm asleep in Cascade Street
When I'm asleep in Cascade Street
I don't remember
I don't remember
In the cascade, in the cascade
You washed me
When I wake up in Cascade Street
When I wake up in Cascade Street
I feel nothing
I feel nothing
In the cascade, in the cascade
You washed meEmbed
