Anna Molly Lyrics
A cloud hangs over this city by the sea
I watch the ships pass and wonder if she might be
Out there and sober as well from loneliness
Please do persist, girl it's time we met and made a mess

I picture your face at the back of my eyes
A fire in the attic, proof of the prize
Anna-Molly, Anna-Molly, Anna-Molly

A cloud hangs over and mutes my happiness
A thousand ships couldn't sail me back from distress
Wish you were here I'm a wounded satellite
I need you now, put me back together, make me right

I picture your face at the back of my eyes
A fire in the attic, proof of the prize
Anna-Molly, Anna-Molly, Anna-Molly
I'm calling your name up into the air
Not one of the others could ever compare!
Anna-Molly, Anna-Molly!

Wait, there is a light
There is a fire
Illuminated attic
Fate, or something better
I could care less
Just stay with me a while
Wait, there is a light
There is a fire
De-fragmenting the attic
Fate, or something better
I could care less
Just stay with me a while, oh
I picture your face at the back of my eyes
A fire in the attic, proof of the prize
Anna-Molly, Anna-Molly, Anna-Molly
I'm calling your name up into the air
Not one of the others could ever compare!
Anna-Molly, Anna-Molly!

(Wait, there is a light
There is a fire) Anna-Molly!
(De-fragmenting the attic)
(Fate, or something better
I could care less) Anna-Molly!
(Just stay with me a while, oh)10Embed
