Haunt LyricsTake yourself apart from me
Down into a flame
You’re everything one could keep
You’re worn with every face

Rapping like a scarecrow’s wings, you unwind
I’m thrown to a seamless wave
And it’s written on a sea of love
And It’s all I can leave you babe
‘Cos the world was never yours
I just keep playing that restless haunt
Nothing I can change

Swallow what’s still brave in you
Like metal in your jaw
Trying not to melt away
Beginning to unthaw

Dead flag, ship of fools you command
I’m trying not to wither away
And I’m wondering if I’ll feel the grace
I’m trying to unlove this world
But it has no other place
I just keep playing that empty hand
Nothing I can cheat
Can you touch?
Can you stay?
Would you weep for the day?
You knew when your eyes closed
But you knew when your eyes closed
Can you want?
Can you stay?
Would you reach around me?

Light another melody
And drown into the sound
I’ve buried every living thing
Deeper than the ground1Embed
