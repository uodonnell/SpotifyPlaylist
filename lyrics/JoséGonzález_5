Step Out LyricsStep outside, time to step outside
Time to step out
Step outside, time to step outside
Time to step outside, time to step outside
House on fire, leave it all behind you
Dark as night, let the lightning guide you
Step outside, time to step outside
Time to step outside, time to step outside
House on fire, leave it all behind you
Living life
Feeding appetites
Stake through
Every heart stop, every go
Being bland
Breathing half the time
House on fire, leave it all behind you
Dark as night, let the lightning guide you
Step outside, time to step outside
Baby, step out
Broke tooth Monday
Something's not the same
Blank head
Crossed eyes sweep the floor
Feel your presence
In your absence, shut the door
House on fire, leave it all behind you
Dark as night, let the lightning guide you
Step outside, time to step outside
Time to step out
Step outside, time to step outside
Time to step outside, time to step outside
House on fire, leave it all behind you
Step outside, time to step outside
Time to step outside, time to step outside
Baby, step out10Embed
