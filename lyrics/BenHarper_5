Amen Omen LyricsWhat started as a whisper
Slowly turned into a scream
Searching for an answer
Where the question is unseen
I don't know where you came from
And I don't know where you've gone
Old friends become old strangers
Between the darkness and the dawn
Amen Omen
Will I see your face again
Amen Omen
Can I find the place within
To live my life without you
I still hear you saying
All of life is a chance
And is sweetest
When at a glance
But I live a hundred
Lifetimes in a day
But I die a little
In every breath that I take
Amen Omen
Will I see your face again
Amen Omen
Can I find the place within
To live my life without you
I listen to a whisper
Slowly drift away
Silence is the loudest
Parting word you never say
I put your world
Into my veins
Now a voiceless sympathy
Is all that remains
Amen Omen
Will I see your face again
Amen Omen
Can I find the place within
To live my life without youEmbed
