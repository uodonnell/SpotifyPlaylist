To Hell We Ride LyricsWith you it's never good enough
Because you want the stuff that could change your future
You're lost amongst a sea of chance
And now the more you dance just gets you sinkin' deeper
It's okay, don't apologize
You don't know what you're striving for and you never seem to try
It's too early, go live your lie
Keep on moving, it's time to
Ride, ride, ride, now it's time to
Ride, ride, ride
Everything seems tempting but nothing comes for free
I often wonder how you drive when the road's too dark to see
It's too early, it's time to
(Ride, ride, ride)
We light the fire to watch it burn
But when it comes your turn all that's left is embers
You ran this race with no real heart, yeah right back at the start
You'd already lost it
It's okay, don't apologize
You don't know what you're striving for and you never seem to try
It's too early, go live your lie
Keep on moving, it's time to
Ride, ride, ride, now its time to
Ride, ride, ride
Everything seems tempting but nothing comes for free
I often wonder how you drive when the road's too dark to see
It's too early, it's time to
Ride, ride, ride
Everything feels tempting when you don't know who to be
I often wonder how you feel when you're lyin' next to me
It's too early, it's time to
Yeah, yeah, yeah, so what?
Yeah, yeah, and after all that time
Yeah, yeah, no answers
Ride, ride
You know it's not enough
You know it's not enough
You know it's not enoughEmbed
