Now That Youâ€™re Gone Lyrics
Never thought it would be like this

What will you do now that you're gone?
Onto somebody new, well, that didn't take long
And where you're gonna go? Not that I care
And who can you trust now that I'm not there?

Never known such unhappiness
Never thought it would be like this
What will I do, now that you're gone?
Now that you're gone

And what will you do now you're all alone?
Who's gonna keep you warm out there in the cold?
And who's gonna rescue you when you're lost at sea?
And who's gonna love you if it isn't me?

Never known such unhappiness
Never thought it would end like this
Oh, what will I do, now that you're gone?
Now that you're gone
Now you're lost in the wilderness
You never dreamed it would end like this
What will they say now that you're gone?
Now that you're, now that you're gone15Embed
