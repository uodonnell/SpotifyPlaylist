Blood Like Lemonade LyricsHealing holy man, once upon a time
He lived for his wife up until the crime
Hunting high and low
To seek revenge
Brand new moral code
Got made reluctant renegade
Leaving empty souls
When he avenged
Evil spirits flowed
He drank the blood like lemonade
Cozy campfire crowd with a case of wine
And feeling fine
Bounty hunter now, and they'd crossed the line
Crossed that line
Hunting high and low
To seek revenge
Brand new moral code
Got made reluctant renegade
Leaving empty souls
When he avenged
Evil spirits flowed
He drank the blood like lemonade
In a border town down in Mexico
They let him go
Law and order now 'cause he runs the show
So now you know
Hunting high and low
Exact revenge
Brand new moral code
Got made reluctant renegade
Leaving empty souls
When he avenged
Evil spirits flowed
He drank the blood like lemonade
Hunting high and low
Exact revenge
Brand new moral code
Got made reluctant renegade
Leaving empty souls
When he avenged
Evil spirits flowed
He drank the blood like lemonade
He drank the blood like lemonade
He drank the blood like lemonade
He drank the blood like lemonade2Embed
