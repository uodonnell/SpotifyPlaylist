It Is What It Is Lyrics
I was only looking for a shortcut home
But it's complicated, so complicated
Somewhere in this city is a road I know
Where we could make it but maybe there's no making it now

Too long we've been denying, now we're both tired of trying
We hit a wall and we can't get over it
Nothing to relive, it's water under the bridge
You said it, I get it, I guess it is what it is

I was only trying to bury the pain
But I made you cry and I can't stop the crying
Was only trying to save me but I lost you again
Now there's only lying, wish I could say it's only me


Here it comes, ready or not
We both found out it's not how we thought
That it would be
How it would be
If the time could turn us around
What was once lost may be found
For you and me
For you and me

I was only looking for a shortcut home
But it's complicated, so complicated2Embed
