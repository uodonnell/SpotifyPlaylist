Tear Away Lyrics
I'm tearing away
Pieces are falling, I can't seem to make them stay
You run away
Faster and faster, you can't seem to get away
Break!

Hope there's a reason
For questions unanswered, I just don't see everything
Yes, I'm inside you
Tell me, how does it feel to feel like this just like I do?

I don't care about anyone else, but me
I don't care about anyone
I don't care about anyone else, but me
I don't care about anyone

Do I really want this?
Sometimes I scare myself, I just can't let it go
Can you believe it?
Everything happens for reasons I just don't know
I don't care about anyone else, but me
I don't care about anyone
I don't care about anyone else, but me
I don't care about anyone or anything but me

Goddamn, I love me

I don't care about anyone else, but me
I don't care about anyone
I don't care about anyone else, but me
I don't care about anyone or anything

I don't care about anyone else, but me
I don't care about anyone3Embed
