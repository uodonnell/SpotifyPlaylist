Resentment Lyrics
Resentment

I need a short-term fix for a long-term problem
Can I learn to love these chains?
I know I had a point but now I forgot it
While I'm circlin' the drain

No, I can't stop feelin' like every day's exactly the same
With a one-track mind I don't think I can change
Trapped in memories stuck on replay, replay, replay

Starts with a spark, then it's a wildfire
Burning me up
Burning me up
A dance with demons on a high wire
Lift me up
Lifting me up
Resentment

You know I lost my voice when I let the rot in
Hard truth cuts both ways
Pourin' out my heart
All that's unforgiven
Washing over me like rain
No, I can't stop feeling like every day's exactly the same
With a one-track mind I don't think I can change
Trapped in memories stuck on replay, replay, replay

Starts with a spark, then it's a wildfire
Burning me up
Burning me up
A dance with demons on a high wire
Lift me up
Lifting me up
Resentment

I've got this chip on my shoulder
So I press the issues on sight
For all who need introduction
Welcome to the eye of the tiger
Go

Starts with a spark, then it's a wildfire
Burning me up
Burning me up
A dance with demons on a high wire
Lift me up
Lifting me up
Starts with a spark, then it's a wildfire
Burning me up
Burning me up
A dance with demons on a high wire
Lift me up
Lifting me up
It's a wildfire
It's a wildfire
Resentment
It's a wildfire
It's a wildfire
