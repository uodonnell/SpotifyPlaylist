Ben Franklin’s Song Lyrics
Electricity! Yeah, you can all thank me
Took some lightning, a kite, and a fat brass key
And they're putting up streetlights in Gay Paris
You’re welcome from our young nation
I’m the only American the French wanna see
They call me a genius, I can’t disagree
They have guns, they have funds
They can set us free, invest in my reputation

And do you know who the fuck I am?
Yeah, do you know who the fuck I am?
Do you know who the fuck I am?
I am Poor-Richard’s-Almanack-writing
Benjamin Fuckin’ Franklin

I said, early to bed, bitches, early to rise
They make a man healthy, wealthy, and wise
Soldiers are fighting for freedom, they have no supplies
So diplomacy happens at night
John Adams debates at the gates of Versailles
He whines and berates and awaits a reply
As I stay up late with a succulent breast or a thigh
Alright, diplomacy happens at night
And do you know who the fuck I am?
Yeah, do you know who the fuck I am?
Do you know who the fuck I am?
I am 76-and-I’ll-Still-Kick-Your-Ass Fuckin’ Franklin

One pain that lingers, the hitch in my stride
Is my son back at home who I could not guide
Who sits all alone in a prison cell on the wrong side
Stands against our young nation
So I play my ambassador part with pride
I am known in the world and the world is wide
To my children, my sins may be magnified
But I’d do it all again, no hesitation

And do you know who the fuck I am?
Yeah, do you know who the fuck I am?
Do you know who the fuck I am?
I am Poor-Richard’s-Almanack-writing
Benjamin Fuckin’ Franklin
(Do you know who the fuck I am?) Who the fuck I am?
(Do you know who the fuck I am?) Who the fuck I am?
(Do you know who the fuck I am?)
I am Poor-Richard’s-Almanack-writing
Polymath, bifocal-wearing
Harp and glass-armonica-playing
