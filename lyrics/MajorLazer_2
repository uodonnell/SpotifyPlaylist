Lean On Lyrics
Do you recall, not long ago
We would walk on the sidewalk?
Innocent, remember?
All we did was care for each other
But the night was warm
We were bold and young
All around, the wind blows
We would only hold on to let go
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All-All-All we need is somebody to lean on

(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
What will we do when we get old?
Will we walk down the same road?
Will you be there by my side?
Standing strong as the waves roll over
When the nights are long
Longing for you to come home
All around, the wind blows
We would only hold on to let go
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All-All-All we need is somebody to lean on

All we need is somebody to lean on
(We need someone to lean on, hey)
(Hey, hey)
All-All-All we need is somebody to lean on
(Major Lazer, hey)
Oh, oh-oh
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
Blow a kiss, fire a gun (Hey, hey)
We need someone to lean on (Hey, hey)
Blow a kiss, fire a gun (Hey, hey)
All we need is somebody to lean on (Hey, hey)
Blow a kiss, fire a gun (Hey, hey)
We need someone to lean on (Hey, hey)
Blow a kiss, fire a gun (Hey, hey)
All-All-All we need is somebody to lean on (Hey, hey)341Embed
