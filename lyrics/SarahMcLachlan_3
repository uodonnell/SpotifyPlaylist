When She Loved Me Lyrics
When somebody loved me, everything was beautiful
Every hour we spent together lives within my heart
And when she was sad, I was there to dry her tears
And when she was happy, so was I
When she loved me

Through the summer and the fall, we had each other, that was all
Just she and I together, like it was meant to be
And when she was lonely, I was there to comfort her
And I knew that she loved me

So the years went by, I stayed the same
But she began to drift away, I was left alone
Still, I waited for the day when she'd say, "I will always love you"

Lonely and forgotten, never thought she'd look my way
And she smiled at me and held me just like she used to do
Like she loved me, when she loved me

When somebody loved me, everything was beautiful
Every hour we spent together lives within my heart
When she loved me8Embed
