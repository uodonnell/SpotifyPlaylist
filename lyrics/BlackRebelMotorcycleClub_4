Echo Lyrics
Maybe you're a little fire
You've been drowning your own desires
But every time I see you smile, the heavens move

Someday you will make it out
And you'll feel your heart break the sound
But if you're scared where prayers are found
I'll be with you, alone in that room

Be still my love
I don't wanna tear you down
Everybody knows my love
Everybody breaks somehow
Don't throw it all away my love
I'll be your all for now

Someday you'll return to silence
With a thousand miles of cave inside us
But every time I feel the quiet
It echoes you

Someday you will make it out
And you'll feel the walls tearing down
If there's a place where lost is found
I'll wait for you, alone in that room
Be still my love
I don't want to tear you down
Everybody knows my love
Everybody breaks somehow
Don't throw it all away my love
I'll be your all for now

I don't wanna run
I don't wanna hide
All I've ever known echoes why
Listen to the word
Listen to the ground
I just wanna fade under the sound
I don't wanna run
I don't wanna hide
All I've ever known echoes why
Listen to the word
Listen to the ground
I just wanna fade under the sound
Until we drown1Embed
