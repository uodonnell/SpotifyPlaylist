One Night Stand Lyrics
Men go slow

You should stay another night with me (Oh, oh, whoa)
A one night stand is all I need, just you and me (Oh)
You should stay another night with me (Oh, oh, whoa)
A one night stand is all I need

Tell me how you like it, baby (Tell me how you want it, baby)
Do you want it fast or slow? (I'll give it to you all night)
'Cause I get so excited, baby (Uh)
When you're taking off my clothes (Damn)
Time and time again
I done tried to be the girl in your life
Boy, I know you're feeling lonely (Yeah, I know)
So if you want it, boy, just come over, boy (Oh, oh)
And I promise you will never want to leave, oh yeah

You should stay another night with me, I just want your body, baby (Oh, oh, whoa)
A one night stand, hey, is all I need, all I need, just you and me (Oh, baby, you)
You should stay another night with me, really want you to stay until the morning come (Oh, oh, whoa)
A one night stand is all I need
Tell me how it feels, when your man don't please you right (Oh, he ain't doing it right)
And tell me how it feels, after I take you on this ride (Yeah, oh, haha)
Ooh, I got the remedy, girl, I'll be your fantasy (Let's do it)
Girl, I'ma kiss from your head to your feet, yeah, satisfaction guaranteed, whoa, oh (damn)
Girl, I didn't come to tease ya, I just wanna please ya (No)
Hope you like this (Like this)
I know you want to be loved, maybe we can make some
Boy, I think that you should stay

You should stay another night with me, yeah, I just want your body, baby (Oh, oh, whoa)
A one night stand, night stand, is all I need, with just you and me (Oh, baby, you)
You should stay another night with me, stay until morning come, stay until the morning comes (Oh, oh, whoa)
A one night stand is all I need (Oh, whoa, ooh)

Baby, he ain't treating you right (Just stay another, another, another)
And I know he ain't hitting it right (You should stay)
That's why you need me in your life, baby
Come here (another, another, another)
Let me kiss on your neck
Down to your chest (A one night stand)
To your navel
I'ma go all the way (Is all I need)
So stay here for another night
You should stay another night with me (Oh, whoa, oh)
A one night is all I need3Embed
