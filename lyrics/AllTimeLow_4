Therapy Lyrics
My ship went down
In a sea of sound
When I woke up alone
I had everything
A handful of moments
I wish I could change
And a tongue like a nightmare that cut like a blade
In a city of fools
I was careful and cool
But they tore me apart like a hurricane
A handful of moments I wish I could change but I was carried away

Give me therapy
I'm a walking travesty
But I'm smiling at everything
Therapy, you were never a friend to me
And you can keep all your misery

My lungs gave out
As I faced the crowd
I think that keeping this up could be dangerous
I'm flesh and bone
I'm a rolling stone
And the experts say I'm delirious
Give me therapy
I'm a walking travesty
But I'm smiling at everything
Therapy, you were never a friend to me
You can take back your misery

Arrogant boy, love yourself so no one has to
They're better off without you (they're better off without you)
Arrogant boy cause a scene like you're supposed to
They'll fall asleep without you
You're lucky if your memory remains

Give me therapy
I'm a walking travesty
But I'm smiling at everything
Therapy, you were never a friend to me
You can take back your misery
Therapy, I'm a walking travesty
But I'm smiling at everything
Therapy, you were never a friend to me
You can choke on your misery41Embed
