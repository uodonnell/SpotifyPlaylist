Don’t Give Up Lyrics
What I've seen
Brought tears to my eyes
Something told me, "Don't give up"
Our time is moving
Just remember
If you believe
It's a shame
Don't you know?

Just tripping away, yeah
Tripping high stepping, yeah
Just tripping away, yeah
Let your love bring us together

No cry
No light
And lead us through
All these hard times
Don't give up
Our time, we're moving
Our time, we're moving
If you believe
Just tripping away, yeah
Tripping high stepping, yeah
Just tripping away, yeah
Let your lovе bring us together
Just tripping away, yeah
Tripping high stеpping, yeah
Just tripping away, yeah
Let your love bring us together
Just tripping away, yeah
Tripping high stepping, yeah
Just tripping away, yeah
Let your love bring us together
Just tripping away, yeah
Tripping high stepping, yeah
Just tripping away, yeah
Let your love bring us togetherEmbed
