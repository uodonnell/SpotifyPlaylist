Sun Lyrics
Ocean blue
What have I done to you?
Cut so deep
Yet growing through and through

Drawn apart, New York and London
All I see now are distant drumlins
The roads I knew became a city
And I wonder, will you wait for me?

Although I'm far away
I know I'll stay
I know I'll stay
Right there with you
Though it might be too late
What would you say?
What would you say?
What would you do?

I built a hive, became one with the bees
But we fell like rain, got lost into the sea
If I don't know, the wind will carry me
So just hold tight
Although I'm far away
I know I'll stay
I know I'll stay
Right there with you
Though it might be too late
What would you say?
What would you say?
What would you do?

Over and over many setting suns
I have run, I have waited for the rain to come
When through that mist, I see the shape of you
And I know, and I know that I'm in love with you

Although I'm far away
I know I'll stay
I know I'll stay
Right there with you
Though it might be too late
What would you say?
What would you say?
What would you do?13Embed
