Everything is AWESOME!!! Lyrics
Everything is awesome
Everything is cool when you're part of a team
Everything is awesome
When you're living out a dream

Everything is better when we stick together
Side by side, you and I are gonna win forever, let's party forever
We're the same, I'm like you, you're like me
We are working in harmony
Everything is awesome
Everything is cool when you're part of a team
Everything is awesome
When you're living out a dream

Woooo! Three, two, one, go!
Have you heard the news? Everyone's talkin'
Life is good 'cause everything's awesome
Lost my job, there's a new opportunity
More free time for my awesome community
I feel more awesome than an awesome possum
Dip my body in chocolate frostin'
Three years later, wash off the frostin'
Smellin' like a blossom, everything is awesome
Stepped in mud, got new brown shoes
It's awesome to win, and it's awesome to lose
Everything is better when we stick together
Side by side, you and I are gonna win forever, let's party forever
We're the same, I'm like you, you're like me
We are working in harmony
Everything is awesome
Everything is cool when you're part of a team
Everything is awesome
When you're living out a dream

Blue skies, bouncy springs
We just named two awesome things
A Nobel prize, a piece of string
You know what's awesome? Everything!
Dogs with fleas, allergies
A book of Greek antiquities
Brand new pants, a very old vest
Awesome items are the best
Trees, frogs, clogs, they're awesome
Rocks, clocks, and socks, they're awesome
Figs, and jigs, and twigs, that's awesome
Everything you see or think or say is awesome
Everything is awesome
Everything is cool when you're part of a team
Everything is awesome
When you're living out a dream47Embed
