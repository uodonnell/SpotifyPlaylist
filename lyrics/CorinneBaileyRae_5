â€™Till It Happens To You Lyrics
I know what I said was heat
Of the moment
But, there's a little truth in
Between the words we've spoken
It's a little late now to fix a heart
That's broken
Please don't ask me where I'm going

Cause I don't know, no I don't know
Anymore
It used feel like heaven, it used feel like
May, I used to hear those violins playing
Harp strings like a symphony
Now they've gone away
Nobody wants to face the truth
But, you won't believe what love can do
Till it happens to you
Till it happens to you

Went to the old flat
Guess I was trying to turn the clock back
But, how come that nothing feels the same now
When I'm with you?
We used to stay up all night in the kitchen when
Our love was new
Ooh love am I a fool to believe in you
Cause I don't know, no I don't know anymore
It used feel like heaven, it used feel like may
I used hear those violins playing harp strings
Like a symphony now there gone away
Nobody wants to know the truth until their
Hearts broken
Don't you dare tell them what you think to do
Until they get over, you can only learn these things
From experience when you get older
I just wish that someone would've told me
Till it happens to you
Till it happens to you
Till it happens to you1Embed
