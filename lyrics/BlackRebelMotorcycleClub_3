Question of Faith LyricsI’m a question of faith
I’m a faded mind
I’m what calls you away
I’m what leaves you in time
I’m a shattered heart
I’m the buried knife
I’m the calling rage
I’m the world at night
I’ll give you what you want if you promise you’ll keep walking away
I’ll give you what you want, keep walking away
Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes
You’re never gonna know, your own, your own
What leads you in the nights, just a question of right
Your mind, your mind, your mind
You’re never gonna know, your own, your own
What leads you in the nights, just a question of right
As you question your own
I’m a question of faith
In a shattered mind
I’m what calls you away
To the world on fire
I’ll give you what you want if you promise you’ll keep walking away
Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes
You’re never gonna know, your own, your own
What leads you in the nights, just a question of right
(As you question your own)
Your mind, your mind, your mind
You’re never gonna know, your own, your own
What leads you in the nights, just a question of right
As you question your own
Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes
You’re never gonna know, your own, your own
What leads you in the nights, just a question of right
As you question your own
Your mind, your mind, your mind
You’re never gonna know, your own, your own
What leads you in the nights, just a question of right
As you question your own
Your mind, your mind, your mind
You’re never gonna know, your own, your own
What leads you in the nights, just a question of right
As you question your ownEmbed
