Shots Lyrics
I'm fucked up!
If you not drunk ladies and gentlemen (Uh-huh?)
Get ready to get fucked up
Let's do it, ha ha
LMFAO (You know what?)
Lil Jon (Yeah!)
All of the alcoholics, where you at?
Let's go, hey!
Hey, hey, hey, uh-huh
Hey, hey, hey, let's go, yeah

When I walk in the club (Yeah), all eyes on me (Yeah)
I'm with the Party Rock crew (Yeah), all drinks are free (All drinks are free)
We like Cîroc (Uh-huh?), we love Patrón (Uh-huh?)
We came to party rock, everybody it's on (Let's go)

Shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots
Shots, shots, shots, shots, shots
Shots, shots, shots, shots, shots
Everybody
Shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots
Shots, shots, shots, shots, shots
Shots, shots, shots, shots, shots
Everybody
The ladies love us when we pour shots
They need an excuse to suck our cocks (Suck my cock)
We came to get crunk (Yeah), how about you? (Yeah)
"Bottoms up," let's go round two (Let's go)

Shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots
Shots, shots, shots, shots, shots
Shots, shots, shots, shots, shots
Everybody
Shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots
Shots, shots, shots, shots, shots
Shots, shots, shots, shots, shots
Everybody

If you ain't getting drunk, get the fuck out the club
If you ain't taking shots, get the fuck out the club
If you ain't come to party, get the fuck out the club
Now where my alcoholics? Let me see ya hands up (What you drinkin on?)
Jägerbombs, Lemondrops
Buttery Nipples, Jello shots
Kamikaze, Three Wise Men
Fuck all that shit, give me some gin
Shots
Patrón's on the rocks and I'm ready for some shots
The women come around every time I'm pouring shots
Their panties hit the ground every time I give 'em shots
So cups in the air, everybody let's take shots

If you feeling drunk, put your hands in the air
And if you trying to fuck put ya hands in the air
Now say: I'm fucked up (I'm fucked up)
I'm fucked up (I'm fucked up)
I'm tryna fuck (I'm tryna fuck)
I'm tryna fuck (I'm tryna fuck)

Shots
Patrón's on the rocks and I'm ready for some shots
The women come around every time I'm pouring shots
Their panties hit the ground every time I give 'em shots
So cups in the air, everybody let's take shots
I'm fucked up (Let's go)
