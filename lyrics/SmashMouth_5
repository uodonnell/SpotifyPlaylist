Sorry About Your Penis LyricsCaught you looking at yourself
Don't worry 'bout it, you look fine
How'd you get your hair so tight?
You can't get laid, you might as well fight
It's February and you got a tan
I gotta hand it to you, man
You're the bull of the ball
You try to stand tall
Thinking you can take 'em all
Sorry about your penis
Sorry about your penis
Sorry about your penis
Caught you looking at yourself
I bet you've got overhead cams
Personalized plates and all
Your truck is probably twenty feet tall
I bet you say, "Dude" a lot
I bet you don't do it at all
And all this anger's building up
You might as well fuck a guy up
Sorry about your penis
Sorry about your penis
Sorry about your penis
Sorry, I'm sorry, so sorry
You don't get it, you never will
Flirting with that macho man overkill
Seeing everything as if it were a sport
The only thing you'll win is a case of warts
Cookie cutter men, you all look alike
Drink 'em up, drink 'em up, fight, fight, fight
Mullet-having ass-grabbing tan-line cheeks 
Don't procreate, please
Sorry about your penis
Sorry about your penis
Sorry about your penis
Sorry about your penis
(I'm so)
Sorry about your penis
(Real)
