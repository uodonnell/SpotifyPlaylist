Daddy Lyrics
Mother, please forgive me
I just had to get out all my pain and suffering
Now that I am done remember I will always love you
I'm your son

Little child, looking so pretty
Come out and play, I'll be your daddy
Innocent child, looking so sweet
I'll rape your mind and now your flesh I reap

You raped, I feel dirty!
It hurt, as a child!
Tied down, "that's a good boy"!
And fuck, your own child!
I scream, no one hears me!
It hurt, I'm not a liar!
My God, saw you watch!
Mommy, why your own child?

Little child, looking so pretty
Come out and play, I'll be your daddy
You raped, I feel dirty!
It hurt, as a child!
Tied down, "that's a good boy"!
And fuck, your own child!
I scream, no one hears me!
It hurt, I'm not a liar!
My God, saw you watch!
Mommy, why?
It's alright
You raped, I feel dirty!
It hurt, as a child!
Tied down, "that's a good boy"!
And fuck, your own child!
I weep, no one hears me!
It hurt, as a child!
Tied down, no one hit me!
And raped your own child!
I'm sick, no one hears me!
It hurt, as a child!
Tied down, "that's a good boy"!
You fucked your own child!
I speak, no one hears me!
It hurt, as a child!
Tied down, no one hears me!
Mommy why your own child?
I didn't touch you there!
Mommy said she didn't care!
I didn't touch you there!
That's why mommy stopped and stared!

Little child, looking so sweet
I rape your mind, and now your flesh I reap

You raped, I feel dirty!
It hurt, as a child!
Tied down, "that's a good boy"!
And fuck, your own child!
I scream, no one hears me!
It hurt, I'm not a liar!
My God, saw you watch!
Mommy, why your own child?
You raped, I feel dirty!
It hurt, I'm not a liar!
My God, saw you watching!
Daddy, why your own child?
I scream, no one hears me!
It hurt, I'm not a liar!
My God, saw you watch!
Mommy, why your own child?
You raped, I feel dirty!
It hurt, I'm not a liar!
My God, saw you watching!
Daddy why, your own child?
I scream, no one hears me!
It hurt, I'm not a liar!
My God, saw you watch!
Mommy, why?
I fuckin' hate you!
Oh, you fucker!
Motherfucker, I fuckin' hate you! Fuck you!
You son of a bitch!
You fuckin' ruined my life!
I wanted to die!
I'm sick of it, motherfucker!
You fuckin' bitch!
I hate you!
I fuckin' hate you!
I hate you!
You piece of shit!
Why?
I hate you!

When I awake I'll see Thy face
When I awake I will see Thy light
Mother awake me from my dreams
Mother awake me in Thy light
Hand in hand we are dancing together
Dancing together in Thy Light12Embed
