We can go to the tropics (Go), sip piña coladas, shorty, I could take you there
Or we can go to the slums, where killers get hung, shorty, I could take you there

You know I could take you (I could take you)
I could take you (I could take you)
Shorty, I could take you there
You know I could take you (I could take you)
I could take you (I could take you)
Shorty, I could take you there

Baby girl, I know it's rough, but come with me, we could take a trip to the hood
It's no problem, girl, it's my city, I could take you there (Take you there)
Little kid with guns, only fifteen, roaming the streets, up to no good
When gun shots just bust, just run quickly, I could show you where (Show you where)
As long you're with me, baby, you'll be alright (Come on)
I'm known in the ghetto, girl, just stay by my side (That's right)
Or we can leave the slums, go to paradise
Babe, it's up to you (Hey), it's whatever you like

We can go to the tropics, sip piña coladas, shorty, I could take you there
Or we can go to the slums, where killers get hung, shorty, I could take you there

You know I could take you (I could take you)
I could take you (I could take you)
Shorty, I could take you there
You know I could take you (I could take you)
I could take you (I could take you)
Shorty, I could take you there

Shorty, come with me, it's no worries, I know the bad mandem where I stay
Police fly past you in a hurry, this is no gun play (Is no gun play)
Don't be scared, I know the West Indies, it's Jamaica, that's where I'm from
Might see something that you're not used to, welcome to the slums (To the slums)

As long you're with me, baby, you'll be alright
I'm known in the ghetto, girl, just stay by my side
Or we can leave the slums, go to paradise
Babe, it's up to you, it's whatever you like
We can go to the tropics, sip piña coladas, shorty, I could take you there (I could take you there, let's go, hey)
Or we can go to the slums, where killers get hung, shorty, I could take you there

You know I could take you (I could take you)
I could take you (I could take you)
Shorty, I could take you there
You know I could take you (I could take you)
I could take you (I could take you)
Shorty, I could take you there

Or we (Or we)
Can go (Can go)
To a place (To a place)
I know you gon' like (Oh, oh, oh)
The beach (The beach)
The breeze (The breeze, that's right)
West Indies (Hey), I call it paradise

We can go to the tropics (Hey), sip piña coladas, shorty, I could take you there
Or we can go to the slums (Go), where killers get hung (Go), shorty, I could take you there

You know I could take you (I could take you)
I could take you (I could take you)
Shorty, I could take you there
You know I could take you (I could take you)
I could take you (I could take you)
Shorty, I could take you there (There)6Embed
