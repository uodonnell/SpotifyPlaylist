Unlonely Lyrics
It could be love
And we could be homies
Once you get to know me
I could be your one and only
I could make you Unlonely
Or we could take it slowly
And we could keep it low key
I could be your one and only
I could make you Unlonely

I've been chasing summer around
Searching for the sunshine
Looking for a good time
Following the good vibes
Listening to intuition as it's happening
Diggin' into life cuz at times it can be saddening
Yea it can be a grey day, if you're lonely
A little rain suddenly turns heavy
But a whole lotta love can make the clouds go away
Maybe the time for us is now

When the table's set for two
And there's nobody with you
Seeing movies by yourself
Let me be your someone else
It could be love
And we could be homies
Once you get to know me
I could be your one and only
I could make you Unlonely
Or we could take it slowly
And we could keep it low key
I could be your one and only
I could make you Unlonely

Love, la-la-la, love
Love, la-la, love
One and only, I could make you Unlonely

I give you my word although I'm making words up
Unlonely ain't a word but I don't give a FRUCK
Cause I'm fresh from the farm where critics can't bother me
Living is tricky as it is so that ain't stopping me
You and me we both agree that no one needs the scrutiny
All we want is peace and love and honestly you ruined me
With your beautiful smile and your style continuity
I'd be a fool not to take the opportunity to say
Hey, we should be homies
I think we could be bigger than cheese and macaroni
We could keep it sweet like Chachi and Joanie
Or maybe just be ourselves: Never Phony
Never second guessing the freindship connection
Parallel living, never in possession
Of your individual personal expression
Together we're just a much better reflection of Love
And we could be homies
Once you get to know me
I could be your one and only
I could make you Unlonely
Or we could take it slowly
And we could keep it low key
I could be your one and only
I could make you Unlonely

Love, la-la-la, love
Love, la-la, love
One and only, I could make you Unlonely
Love, la-la-la, love
Love, la-la, love
One and only, I could make you Unlonely

When the table's set for two
And there's nobody with you
Seeing movies by yourself
Let me be your someone else
If you're spending time alone
If it's just you and your phone
Taking pictures of yourself
Baby, maybe I can help
It could be love
And we could be homies
Once you get to know me
I could be your one and only
I could make you Unlonely
Or we could take it slowly
And we could keep it low key
I could be your one and only
I could make you Unlonely

Love, la-la-la, love
Love, la-la, love
One and only, I could make you unlonely
It could be love
And we could be homies (Love, la-la-la, love)
And once you get to know me (Love, la-la, love)
I could be your one and only
I could make you Unlonely3Embed
