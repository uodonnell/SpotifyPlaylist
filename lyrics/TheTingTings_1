Thatâ€™s Not My Name Lyrics
Four-letter word just to get me along
It's a difficulty, and I'm bitin' on my tongue
And I, I keep stallin', not keepin' it together
People around gotta find somethin' to say now
Holdin' back, every day the same
Don't wanna be a loner, listen to me, oh, no
I never say anything at all
But with nothing to consider, they forget my name-ame-ame-ame

They call me hell
They call me Stacey
They call me her
They call me Jane
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
They call me quiet
But I'm a riot
Mary-Jo-Lisa
Always the same
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
I miss the catch if they throw me the ball
I'm the last drip standin' up against the wall
Keep fa-falling, these heels that keep me borin'
Gettin' clamped up and sittin' on the fence now
So alone all the time and I
Lock myself away, listen to me, oh, no
And though I'm dressed up, out and all
With everything considered, they forget my name-ame-ame-ame

They call me hell (This song was in my head)
They call me Stacey (Now it's in my mind)
They call me her (Call it, reach it, get some words)
They call me Jane (And get some timing)
That's not my name (And though I realize)
That's not my name (I cannot emphasize)
That's not my name (I'll stick around)
That's not my name (It's just a promise, nothing binding)
They call me quiet (Baby, can't you see?)
But I'm a riot (That you're so desperately)
Mary-Jo-Lisa (A standing joker)
Always the same (Like a vocal one-liner)
That's not my name (Instead of sing-a-long)
That's not my name (This song is monotone)
That's not my name (I gotta get some soul)
That's not my name (I gotta get some feeling)
Are you calling me darling?
Are you calling me bird?
Are you calling me darling?
Are you calling me bird?

They call me hell (Are you calling me darling?)
They call me Stacey
They call me her
They call me Jane
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
They call me quiet (Are you calling me bird?)
But I'm a riot
Mary-Jo-Lisa
Always the same
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name

They call me hell (This song was in my head)
They call me Stacey (Now it's in my mind)
They call me her (Call it, reach it, get some words)
They call me Jane (And get some timing)
That's not my name (And though I realize)
That's not my name (I cannot emphasize)
That's not my name (I'll stick around)
That's not my name (It's just a promise, nothing binding)
They call me quiet (Baby, can't you see?)
But I'm a riot (That you're so desperately)
Mary-Jo-Lisa (A standing joker)
Always the same (Like a vocal one-liner)
That's not my name (Instead of sing-a-long)
That's not my name (This song is monotone)
That's not my name (I gotta get some soul)
That's not my name (I gotta get some feeling)
They call me hell (This song was in my head)
They call me Stacey (Now it's in my mind)
They call me her (Call it, reach it, get some words)
They call me Jane (And get some timing)
That's not my name (And though I realize)
That's not my name (I cannot emphasize)
That's not my name (I'll stick around)
That's not my name (It's just a promise, nothing binding)
(So alone all the time and I lock myself away)
They call me quiet (Baby, can't you see?)
But I'm a riot (That you're so desperately)
Mary-Jo-Lisa (A standing joker)
Always the same (Like a vocal one-liner)
(Though I'm dressed up, out and all)
That's not my name (Instead of sing-a-long)
That's not my name (This song is monotone)
(With everything considered they forget my name)
That's not my name (I gotta get some soul)
That's not my name (I gotta get some feeling)

This song was in my head
Now it's in my mind
Call it, reach it, get some words and get some timing
And though I realize
I cannot emphasize
I'll stick around, it's just a promise, nothing binding
Baby, can't you see?
That you're so desperately
A standing joker like a vocal one-liner
Instead of sing-a-long
This song is monotone
I gotta get some soul, I gotta get some feeling10Embed
