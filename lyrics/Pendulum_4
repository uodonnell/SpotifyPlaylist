Propane Nightmares Lyrics
Something’s tearing me down
And I can’t help but feel it’s coming from you
She’s a gunshot bride, and her trigger cries
I just wonder what we’ve gotten ourselves into

In a trail of fire I know we will be free again
In the end we will be one
In a trail of fire I’ll burn before you bury me
Set your sights for the sun

Mind is willing
Soul remains
This woman cannot be saved
From the trail into the fire
Mind is willing
Soul remains
This woman cannot be saved
From the trail into the fire
Anything to bring it on home
Bring it on home
Bring it on home
Bring it on home
Flesh too weak to choke the self
Heal the wounds or crack the shell
Lift yourself from what’s below
Flesh too weak to choke the self
Heal the wounds or crack the shell
Lift yourself from what’s below
Raise the anchor, bring it on home
Bring it on home
Bring it on home
Bring it on home

In a trail of fire I know we will be free again
In the end we will be one
In a trail of fire I’ll burn before you bury me
Set your sights for the sun
Bring it on home8Embed
