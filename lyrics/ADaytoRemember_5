You Be Tails, I’ll Be Sonic Lyrics
I’m a mess, that's the best way to describe it
Having no time to myself is the only way I can fight it
When I'm alone it's like I'm staring into a mirror
Don't know the person inside it and that's never been any clearer
I miss your family and I miss all our friends
If you had it to do over, would you do it over again?
'Cause I would, it means something more to me
There's a hole in my heart where you used to be

I still wish you the best of luck, baby
And don't go thinking that this was a waste of time
I couldn't forget you if I tried

You killed what was left of the good in me
I'm tired, so let me be broken
Look down at the mess that's in front of me
No other words need be spoken
And I've got nobody else to blame though I tried
Kept all of our past mistakes held inside
I’ll live with regret for my whole life

I confess that I brought this all on myself
Condemned to suffer alone, like there's nobody else
When you're gone, it's like a whole part of me’s missing
So I'll keep living the lie and just hope that you're listening
I tried to make us a life here
But our foundation was built on sand
No time to run until the damage was done
And I’ve never had the upper hand
I still wish you the best of luck, baby
And don't go thinking that this was a waste of time
I couldn't forget you if I tried

You killed what was left of the good in me
I'm tired, so let me be broken
Look down at the mess that's in front of me
No other words need be spoken
And I've got nobody else to blame though I tried
Kept all of our past mistakes held inside
I’ll live with regret for my whole life

All the things you love are all the things I hate
How did we get here in the first place? Oh!

I play it cool, but it's hard to be (All my trust!)
Is slowly burning inside of me (Over what?)
There can't be anymore progress, I know our fate
The only thing that can heal this is time and space

You killed what was left of the good in me
I'm tired, so let me be broken
Look down at the mess that's in front of me
No other words need be spoken
And I've got nobody else to blame though I tried
Kept all of our past mistakes held inside
I’ll live with regret for my whole life
For my whole life!5Embed
