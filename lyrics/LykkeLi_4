â€‹deep end Lyrics
Wait up, don't wanna wait up for you baby
Still I wait up, lonely in the canyon
No love, there's no love reflecting in the glow of
Million dollar man

Show me your cut, baby, come clean
Come out of your smokescreen
If you really love me, open my eyes
Babe, you burned me
Your kiss is salty chlorine

Swimming pool, swimming pool
Swimming pool, swimming pool
Indigo, deep blue, deep blue
Oh, baby I know where you've been
I know where you been, in the deep end
Swimming pool, swimming pool
Swimming pool, swimming pool
Indigo, deep blue, deep blue
Oh, baby I know where you've been
I know where you been, in the deep end

Hold on, don't wanna hold on
If you let go, I can't go on
It takes two to dance
Show me your cut, baby, come clean
Come out of your smokescreen
If you really love me, open my eyes
Babe, you burned me
Your kiss is salty chlorine

Swimming pool, swimming pool
Swimming pool, swimming pool
Indigo, deep blue, deep blue
Oh, baby I know where you've been
I know where you been, in the deep end
Swimming pool, swimming pool
Swimming pool, swimming pool
Indigo, deep blue, deep blue
Oh, baby I know where you've been
I know where you been, in the deep end

I'm in it, I'm in it
I was only gonna touch ya, now I'm in it
I'm in it, swimming in it
I wasn't gonna love you now
I'm so fucking deep in it
I think I feel another wave, another wave
I'm diving in, I'm diving in it anyway
I'm in it, I'm in it
I was only gonna touch it now
I'm in it
Swimming pool, swimming pool
Swimming pool, swimming pool
Indigo, deep blue, deep blue
Oh, baby I know where you've been
I know where you been, in the deep end
Swimming pool, swimming pool
Swimming pool, swimming pool
Indigo, deep blue, deep blue
Oh, baby I know where you've been
I know where you been, in the deep end17Embed
