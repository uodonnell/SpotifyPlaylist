Man’s World Lyrics
Cheeks are rosy like a Boucher cherub
I'm a strawberry soda, raise my lashes to heaven
Stars in my hair running like a waterfall
Clouds in the whites of our eyes, we saw it all
Burnt me at the stake, you thought I was a witch
Centuries ago, now you just call me a bitch

Mother Nature's dying
Nobody's keeping score
I don't wanna live in a man's world anymore
I don't wanna live in a man's world anymore
Anymore

Marilyn's bungalow, it's number seven
In the pink palace where men made her legend
Owned by a sheik who killed thousands of gay men
I guess that's why he bought the campest hotel in LA then

Mother Nature's dying
Nobody's keeping score
I don't wanna live in a man's world anymore
I don't wanna live in a man's world anymore
If you have a mother, daughter or a friend
Maybe it is time, time you comprehend
The world that you live in ain't the same one as them
So don't punish me for not being a man

Spring appears when the time is right
Women are violets coming to light
Don't underestimate the making of life
The planet has a funny way of stopping a fight

Mother Nature's dying
Nobody's keeping score
I don't wanna live in a man's world anymore
I don't wanna live in a man's world anymore

If you have a mother, daughter or a friend
Maybe it is time, time you comprehend
The world that you live in ain't the same one as them
So don't punish me 'cause I'm not a man

So don't punish me 'cause I'm not a man
'Cause I'm not a man72Embed
