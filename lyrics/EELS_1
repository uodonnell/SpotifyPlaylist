I Need Some Sleep Lyrics
I need some sleep
It can't go on like this
I tried counting sheep
But there's one I always miss

Everyone says I'm getting down too low
Everyone says, "You just got to let it go"
You just got to let it go
You just got to let it go

I need some sleep
Time to put the old horse down
I'm in too deep
And the wheels keep spinning 'round

Everyone says I'm getting down too low
Everyone says, "You just got to let it go"
You just got to let it go
You just got to let it go

You just got to let it go
You just got to let it go
You just got to let it go9Embed
