I Hope That I Don’t Fall in Love with You Lyrics
Well, I hope that I don't fall in love with you
'Cause falling in love just makes me blue
Well, the music plays and you display your heart for me to see
I had a beer and now I hear you callin' out for me
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you

Well, the room is crowded—people everywhere
And I wonder, should I offer you a chair?
Well, if you sit down with this old clown, I'll take that frown and break it
Before the evening's gone away, I think that we can make it
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you

Well, the night does funny things inside a man
These old tomcat feelings you don't understand
Well, I turn around to look at you, you light a cigarette
I wish I had the guts to bum one, but we've never met
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you

I can see that you are lonesome just like me
And it being late, you'd like some company
Well, I turn around to look at you, and you look back at me
The guy you're with, he's up and split—the chair next to you is free
And I hope that you don't fall in love with me
Now, it's closing time
The music's fading out
Last call for drinks, I'll have another stout
Well, I turn around to look at you—you're nowhere to be found
I search the place for your lost face—guess I'll have another round
And I think that I just fell in love with you16Embed
