I’m Yours Lyrics
Well you done done me in; you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
Now I'm trying to get back
Before the cool done run out
I'll be giving it my bestest
Nothing's going to stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some

But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours

Well open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find
Love, love, love, love
Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing
We're just one big family
And it's our God-forsaken right to be
Loved, love, love, love, loved
So I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm sure
There's no need to complicate
Our time is short
This is our fate, I'm yours

Do you want to come on scootch on over closer, dear
And I will nibble your ear

I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed
I guess what I be saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue

But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait – I'm yours
Well open up your mind and see like me (I won't hesitate)
Open up your plans and damn you're free (No more, no more)
Look into your heart and you'll find (It cannot wait)
The sky is yours (I'm sure)
So please don't, please don't, please don't (No need to complicate)
There's no need to complicate (Our time is short)
'Cause our time is short (This is)
This oh, this oh, this is our fate (our fate)
I'm yours134Embed
