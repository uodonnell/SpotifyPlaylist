I Wanna Get Lost with You Lyrics
Do you remember the light in the flame?
It was a birthday party of someone
Then you told me your name
For you were one in a million

I wanna get lost with you
It's the only thing I wanna do
Get out of my mind with you
So come on over

I walked you home in the rain
Speaking the same language
You were running around in my brain
Then you sent me a message
It said…

I wanna get lost with you
It's the only thing I wanna do
Get out of my mind with you
So come on over
I wanna get lost with you
It's the only thing I wanna do
Get out of my mind with you
So come on over
I know we did some wrong
You told me that now
When I came to you
That you were with someone
If God messed up
With so much stuff
Like living a loaded gun
But now that I'm out of my mind with you
We got that day in the sun

I wanna get lost with you
It's the only thing I wanna do
Get out of my mind with you
So come on over

I wanna get lost with you
It's the only thing I wanna do
Get out of my mind with you
So come on over
So come on over
So come on over
Come on over
I wanna get lost with you
I wanna get lost with you
Wanna get lost with you
Yeah-yeah
So come on over…2Embed
