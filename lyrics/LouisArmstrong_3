Go Down Moses Lyrics
Go down, Moses
Way down in Egypt's land
Tell old Pharaoh to
Let my people go

When Israel was in Egypt's land
Let my people go
Oppress'd so hard they could not stand
Let my people go

So the Lord said:
“Go down, Moses
Way down in Egypt's land
Tell old Pharaoh to
Let my people go”

So Moses went to Egypt's land
Let my people go
He made old Pharaoh understand
Let my people go

Yes, the Lord said:
“Go down, Moses
Way down in Egypt's land
Tell old Pharaoh to
Let my people go”
Thus spoke the Lord, bold Moses said
Let my people go
“If not I'll smite your firstborns dead”
Let my people go

God, the Lord, said:
“Go down, Moses
Way down in Egypt's land
Tell old Pharaoh to
Let my people go”

Tell old Pharaoh to
Let my people goEmbed
