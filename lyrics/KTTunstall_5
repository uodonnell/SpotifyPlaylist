1000 Years LyricsA thousand years
Is a long long time
Even for a star up in the sky
I could count the tears
And the long long nights
But I'd rather just remember how you smile
In a thousand years
I know that our love will still be here
So close your eyes, my dear
Knowing that our love is going to last one thousand years
The time flies by
In a blinking eye
No matter how we try to make it last
But if souls are strong
They'll go on and on
And we will hardly know the time has passed
In a thousand years
I know that our love will still be here
So close your eyes, my dear
Knowing that our love is going to last one thousand years
We'll disappear
If we can keep each other here
Inside our hearts
We will never be apart so don't you fear
Dry your tears
In a thousand years
I know that our love will still be here
In a thousand years
Ohh
So close your eyes, my dear
Knowing that our love is going to last one thousand yearsEmbed
