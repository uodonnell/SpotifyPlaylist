These Words Lyrics
My heart
These words are my own
(Uh, yeah, uh)

Threw some chords together
The combination: D-E-F
It's who I am, it's what I do (Yeah, uh)
And I was gonna lay it down for you
I try to focus my attention
But I feel so A-D-D
I need some help, some inspiration (But it's not coming easily)

(Whoa) Tryna find the magic
(Oh) Tryna write a classic (Whoa)
Don't you know, don't you know, don't you know? (Whoa, whoa)
Wastebin full of paper (Whoa)
Clever rhymes, see ya later

These words are my own
From my heart flow (Yeah, uh)
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
There's no other way
To better say
I love you, I love you, I love you (Ah)
Read some Byron, Shelley, and Keats
Recited it over a hip-hop beat
I'm having trouble saying what I mean (Uh)
With dead poets and drum machines
You know I had some studio time booked
But I couldn't find the killa hook
Now you've gone and raised the bar right up
Nothing I write is ever good enough

These words are my own (These words are my own)
From my heart flow (From my heart flow)
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
There's no other way (There's no other way)
To better say (Uh)
I love you, I love you, I love you (I love you, I love you)
These words are my own (These words are my own)
From my heart flow (Yeah)
(I love you) I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you (I love you)
There's no other way (There's no other way)
To better say
I love you, I love you, I love you

I'm gettin' off my stage
The curtains pull away
No hyperbole to hide behind
My naked soul exposes (Love you, love you)
Whoa, oh
Whoa, whoa
(Whoa) Tryna find the magic
(Whoa) Tryna write a classic (Uh, yeah)
Wastebin full of paper
Clever rhymes, see you later

These words are my own (These words are my own)
From my heart flow (Don't you know?)
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
There's no other way (There's no other way, to better say)
To better say (Yeah, uh, yeah)
I love you, I love you, I love you
These words are my own (These words are my own)
From my heart flow (They are from my heart, yeah)
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you (I love you)
There's no other way (There's no better way)
To better say (Yeah, uh, yeah)
I love you, I love you, I love you

These words are my own
They're from my heart (My heart)
(Yeah, uh) I love you, I love you
That's all I got to say
Can't think of a better way
And that's all I've got to say (Yeah, uh, yeah)
I love you, is that okay?4Embed
