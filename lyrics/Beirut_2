Gibraltar Lyrics
Everything should be fine
You'll find things tend to stand in line
It's but a link in time
But I'm sure you'll let me try

Oh, sitting on fire
So long we're waiting on by

Who laid a line?
Say you're like my kind
You loved the times
I sang your loss was mine
Who laid a line?
Say you're like my kind
You loved the times
I sang your loss was mine
In your mind
In your mmm
In your mind's eye
In your mmm
In your mind's eye
In your mmm
In your mind's eye
In your mmm
Ooooh-mmm

Oh, sitting on fire
So long we're waiting on by

Who laid a line?
Say you're like my kind
You loved the times
I sang your loss was mine
Who laid a line?
Say you're like my kind
You loved the times
I sang your loss was mine4Embed
