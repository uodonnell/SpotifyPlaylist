Kept Lyrics
Stranger things will come before you
Always out of the way
I keep these promises, these promises
Stranger things will come before you
Always out of the way
I keep these promises, these promises
Stranger things will come before you
Always out of the way
I keep these promises, these promises
Stranger things will come before you
Always out of the way
I keep these promises, these promises
Stranger things will come before you
Always out of the way
I keep these promises, these promises
Stranger things will come before you
Always out of the way
I keep these promises, these promises
Stranger things will come before you
Always out of the way
I keep these promises, these promises
Stranger things will come before you
Always out of the way
I keep these promises, these promises13Embed
