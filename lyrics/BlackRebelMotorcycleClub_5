Spook Lyrics
I need the violence on the radio
I need a murderous sound just to let me know
There's no one talking to me, but I'm talking back
And every word's a ghost I keep looking at

It's another song
Then it's gone
It's just another song
And then it's gone

I'll be your innocent lie, lie, lie
I'll be your last mistake (you take, you take)
Everything a little lie, lie, lie
I never really can

I hear the hollow trace of a tragic line
It got the kids in tow just to feed their mind
But sniffing only can pull apart
It takes a dead-end soul to kill a dead-end heart

It's another song
Then it's gone
It's just another song
And then it's gone
I'll be your innocent lie, lie, lie
I'll be the last mistake (you take, you take)
Everything a little lie, lie, lie
I never really can

I'm gonna tell you how it feels
I'm gonna tell you how it was
I'm waiting on a call, yeah
I'm waiting on a vision
I'm waiting on the fall of this dead song city
I'm waiting on the call
And I'm waiting on a vision
I'm waiting on the fall of this dead song city
Been waiting on the fall of this dead song city
Been waiting on the fall of this dead song city
Been waiting on the fall of this dead song city
Been waiting on the fall of this dead song city

I'll be your innocent lie, lie, lie
I'll be the last mistake (you take, you take)
Everything a little lie, lie, lieEmbed
