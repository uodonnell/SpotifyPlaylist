The Spoils Lyrics
I got that feeling
That bad feeling that you don't know
I don't even know her
But I hope that
She comforts you tonight

Nobody here
That keeps you in the shade
And ever owned you
Some sentimental tears
Or someone else's girl that drips away

But I somehow slowly love you
And wanna keep you
The same
Well, I somehow slowly know you
And wanna keep you
Away

I got that feeling
That bad feeling that you don't know
I don't even know her
But I hope that
She comforts you tonight
And I somehow slowly love you
And wanna keep you this way
Well, I somehow slowly know you
And wanna keep you
Away
Away

And I somehow slowly love you
And wanna keep you this way
Well, I somehow slowly know you
And wanna keep you

But I somehow slowly love you
And wanna keep you the same
Well, I somehow slowly know you
And wanna keep you
