Touchin, Lovin Lyrics
Ooh, woo, yeah
Ayy
Young Money
Uh-huh
Trigga Trey
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Uh, let's get it, rrrrrrrr

No, I ain't tryna flex (Tryna flex)
No ceilings, you can see who's in it, oh
If we're talkin' about sex (Girl, you gon' think)
Haha, girl, you know that I invented that (Invented that)
And I'm onto the next (Next)
That's unless you bring a friend who with it
Oh, I'm sorry
Oh, you mad that I came to the party?

Like, no, no, no (Uh-huh)
You took your girl to the club and now she gone (Uh-huh)
Now she asking me when I'm takin' her home (Uh-huh)
I tell her, "Let's go" (Leggo)
Long as you know 'cause I know when we get alone, that
I'm touchin' you tonight
(Nah) I'm lovin' you tonight
(Wait, no) I'm fuckin' you, girl
You must be used to spendin', puttin' in that time (Uh-huh)
Touchin', lovin', fuckin', can't make up my mind (My mind, oh, oh)
I'm lovin' you (Oh, oh)
(Wait, no) I'm fuckin' you tonight

Girl, you fuckin with the best (Best)
Take a picture while I'm deep up in it, oh
And if they livin' right next (Next, next)
Then I bet they know my name in a minute (Trigga)
Let me feel your body sweat (Sweat)
I promise I'll keep your body dripping
Oh, I'm sorry
Niggas mad 'cause I came to the party

Like, no, no, no (Uh-huh)
You took your girl to the club
And now she gone (Uh-huh)
Now she asking me
When I'm takin' her home, home, home (Uh-huh)
I tell her, "Let's go" (Leggo)
Long as you know 'cause I know when we get alone, that
I'm touchin' you tonight
(Nah) I'm lovin' you tonight
(Wait, no) I'm fuckin' you, girl
You must be used to spendin', putting in that time (Uh-huh)
Touchin', lovin', fuckin', can't make up my mind (My mind, oh, oh)
I'm lovin' you (Oh, oh)
(Wait, no) I'm fuckin' you tonight

Yo, sometimes I tell 'em I love 'em because I just wanna fuck 'em
I never love 'em or cuff 'em, and when we done I'ma duck 'em
He Ferragamo the buckle, he Louis V on the duffel
The pussy wetter than puddles, I ride his dick like a shuttle
I said, real niggas let real bitches cum first (Cum first)
And real bitches been bad bitches from birth (From birth)
Ugh, kiss him when he cumming (Oh)
Made more money last year than Mister Drummond (Kyuhh)
Oh, he like it when I ride it slow

I'm touchin' you tonight (Ugh, yeah)
(Nah) I'm lovin' you tonight (Uh-huh)
(Wait, no) I'm fuckin' you, girl
You must be used to spendin', putting in that time (Uh-huh)
Touchin', lovin', fuckin', can't make up my mind (My mind, oh, oh)
(Nicki, you know that I love it)
I'm lovin' you (Oh, oh)
(And I really wanna touch you, hahaha)
(Wait, no) I'm fuckin' you tonight
What you mean, "Wait, no?" Like, what?
You better act like you know, nigga, it's Nicki Minaj
