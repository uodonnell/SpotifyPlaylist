Running Away Lyrics
I don't want you to give it all up
And leave your own life collecting dust
And I don't want you to feel sorry for me
You never gave us a chance to be
And I don't need you to be by my side
To tell me that everything's alright
I just wanted you to tell me the truth
You know I'd do that for you

So why are you running away?
Why are you running away?

I did enough to show you that I
Was willing to give and sacrifice
And I was the one who was lifting you up
When you thought your life had, had enough
And when I get close, you turn away
There's nothing that I can do or say
So now I need you to tell me the truth
You know I'd do that for you

So why are you running away?
Why are you running away?
Is it me? (Is it me) Is it you? (Is it you)
Nothing that (Nothing that)
I can do (I can do)
To make you (To make you)
Change your mind
Is it me? Is it you?
(Why do you run away won't you tell)
Nothing that I can do
Is it a waste of time?
(Why do you run away)
Is it me? Is it you?
Nothing that I can do
To make you change your mind, no

So why are you running away?
Why are you running away?
(What is it I have to say...)
So why are you running away?
(...to make you admit you're afraid?)
Why are you running away?1Embed
