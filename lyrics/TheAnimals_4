Itâ€™s My Life Lyrics

It's a hard world to get a break in
All the good things have been taken
But girl there are ways
To make certain things pay
Though I'm dressed in these rags
I'll wear sable someday

Hear what I say
I'm gonna ride the serpent
No more time spent
Sweatin' rent
Hear my command
I'm breakin' loose
It ain't no use
Holdin' me down
Stick around
But baby (Baby)
Remember (Remember)

It's my life and I'll do what I want
It's my mind and I'll think like I want
Show me I'm wrong, hurt me sometime
But some day, I'll treat you real fine

There'll be women and their fortunes
Who just want to mother orphans
Are you gonna cry
When I'm squeezin' them dry?
Taking all I can get
No regrets

When I openly lie, ha
And live on their money
Believe me, honey
That money
Can you believe?
I ain't no saint
No complaints
So girl, throw out
Any doubt
And baby (Baby)
Remember (Remember)

It's my life and I'll do what I want
It's my mind and I'll think what I want
Show me I'm wrong, hurt me sometime
But some day, I'll treat you real fine
(It's my life and I'll do what I want)
Don't push me!
(It's my mind and I'll think what I want)
It's my life!
(It's my life and I'll do what I want)
And I can do what I want!
(It's my mind and I'll think what I want)
You can't tell me, baby!
(It's my life and I'll do what I want)
I'm gonna do what I want...3Embed
