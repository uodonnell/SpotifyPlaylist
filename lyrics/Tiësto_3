Red Lights Lyrics
Blacked out
Everything faded on your love
I’m already wasted so close
That I can taste it now, now
So let’s break right out of these gilded cages
We’re going to make it now
Don’t ever turn around
Don’t ever turn around

Nobody else needs to know
Where we might go
We could just run them red lights
We could just run them red lights
There ain’t no reason to stay
We’ll be light years away
We could just run them red lights
We could just run them red lights
We could just run them red lights

White lights, flirt in the darkness
This road leads where your heart is
These signs, something we can’t ignore
We can’t back down
We’ll never let them change us
We’re going to make it now
What are we waiting for...
What are we waiting for...
Nobody else needs to know
Where we might go
We could just run them red lights
We could just run them red lights
There ain’t no reason to stay
We’ll be light years away
We could just run them red lights
We could just run them red lights
We could just run them red lights
We could just run them red lights
We could just run them red lights
We could just run them red lights16Embed
