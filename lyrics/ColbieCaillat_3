Brighter Than the Sun Lyrics
Stop me on the corner
Swear you hit me like a vision
I, I, I wasn't expecting
But who am I to tell fate where it's supposed to go?
With it
Don't you blink; you might miss it
See, we got a right to just love it or leave it
You find it and keep it
'Cause it ain't every day you get the chance to say...

Oh, this is how it starts, lightning strikes the heart
It goes off like a gun, brighter than the sun
Oh, we could be the stars, falling from the sky
Shining how we want, brighter than the sun

I'd never seen it
But I found this love, I'm gonna feed it
You better believe
I'm gonna treat it better than anything I've ever had
'Cause you're so damn beautiful
Read it, it's signed and delivered, let's seal it
Boy, we go together like peanuts and Paydays
Marley and reggae
And everybody needs to get a chance to say...
Oh, this is how it starts, lightning strikes the heart
It goes off like a gun, brighter than the sun
Oh, we could be the stars, falling from the sky
Shining how we want, brighter than the sun

Everything is like a white out
'Cause we shika-shika shine down
Even when the, when the light's out, but I can see you glow
Got my head up in the rafters, got me happy ever after
Never felt this way before, ain't felt this way before
I swear you hit me like a vision
I, I, I wasn't expecting
But who am I to tell fate where it's supposed to go?

Oh, this is how it starts (This is how it starts)
Lightning strikes the heart (Lightning strikes the heart)
It goes off like a gun, brighter than the sun
Oh, we could be the stars, falling from the sky (Falling from the sky)
Shining how we want, brighter than the sun
Oh, this is how it starts (This is how it starts)
Lightning strikes the heart (Lightning strikes the heart)
It goes off like a gun, brighter than the sun
Oh, we could be the stars, falling from the sky
Shining how we want (Shining how we want)
Brighter than the sun
Brighter than the sun
Brighter than the sun
Brighter than the sun
Oh-o, yeah, oh-o

Oh, this is how it starts, lightning strikes the heart
It goes off like a gun, brighter than the sun
Oh, this is how it starts, lightning strikes the heart
It goes off like a gun, brighter than the sun
Oh, this is how it starts, lightning strikes the heart
It goes off like a gun, brighter than the sun
Oh, this is how it starts, lightning strikes the heart
It goes off like a gun, brighter than the sun3Embed
