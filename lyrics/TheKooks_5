Junk of the Heart (Happy) Lyrics
Junk of the heart is junk in my mind
So hard to leave you all alone
We get so drunk that we can hardly see
What use is that to you or me, baby?

See, I notice nothing makes you shatter, no, no
You're a lover of the wild and a joker of the heart
But are you mine?

I wanna make you happy
I wanna make you feel alive
Let me make you happy
I wanna make you feel alive at night
I wanna make you happy
Are you a good girl through the night?

We sink to be sunk, life is no race
When I'm not happy, I'm in disgrace

So I spend time a-guessing on you, oh
You're a lover of the wild and a joker of the heart
But are you mine?
I wanna make you happy
I wanna make you feel alive
Let me make you happy
I wanna make you feel alive at night
I wanna make you happy
Are you a good girl through the night?
Yeah

Still I notice nothing makes you shatter no, no
You're a lover of the wild and a joker of the heart
But are you mine?

I wanna make you happy
I wanna make you feel alive
Let me make you happy
I wanna make you feel alive at night
I wanna make you happy
Are you a good girl through the night?14Embed
