Don’t You Evah Lyrics
I told you I can't make it slay
Jim, can you record the talkback
Record that, Jim
Bet!
Man, Jim
Jim, record that
Jim, can you record the talkback

Bet you got it all planned right
Bet you never worry
Never even feel a fright
Bet you got it all planned right
Never fit to worry
Never even feel a fright
Single sleeps alone
And I know you don't really mind
Five years by your side
So I know you really don't mind

But don't you never be down
I said don't evah
Because it's going to keep him hanging around
Never be down
I said don't evah
Because it's going to keep him hanging around
Don't you never think it's right
Bet you think you had to but it doesn't feel right
Bet you never think it feels right
Famous-sounding words make your head feel light
Petals getting picked
With the love-yous
And the love-you-not
Five years going by
Everyone is standing on their side

But don't you never be down
I said don't evah
Because it's going to keep him hanging around
Never be down
I said don't evah
Because it's going to keep him hanging around
But don't you never be down
I said don't evah
Because it's going to keep him hanging around
Never (Five years going by)
Be down (Everyone is standing on their side)
I said don't evah
Because it's going to keep him hanging around
Five years going by (​Bet you got it all planned right)
Everyone is standing on their side
(​Bet you never worry)
Because it's going to keep him hanging around (​Never even feel a fright)
Five years going by (​Bet you got it all planned right)
Everyone is standing on their side
I said don't evah (​Never fit to worry)
Because it's going to keep him hanging around (​Never even feel a fright)2Embed
