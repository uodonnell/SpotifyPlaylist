Fuck Me LyricsI know you know we're all falling into a deep oblivion
I know you know we're all falling into a neverending mess
So we have to take care, take care, and share it, share it, share it together (x2)
So let's get undressed, we need to feel it
Please let's get undressed, we need to live it
Fuck me fuck me fuck me fuck me, and make me come again, and make me come again (x2)
I know you know we're all falling into a deep oblivion
I know you know we're all falling into a neverending mess
So we have to take care, take care, and share it, share it, share it together (x2)
Please let's get undressed, we need to feel it
Please let's get undressed, we need to live it
Love me love me love me love me, you make me love again, you make me love again (x2)
Love me love me love me love me, you make me love again, you make me love again love me love me love me love me, you make me love again, you make me love again love me love me love me love me, you make me love again, you make me love again ...Embed
