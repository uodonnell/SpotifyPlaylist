Never Gonna Stop (The Red, Red Kroovy) Lyrics(Use my body to keep you alive)

Yeah
I'm on Durango, number 95
Take me to the home, kick boots and ultra live
See heaven flash a horror show
Knock it nice and smooth, step back and watch it flow, yeah

Never gonna stop me, never gonna stop
Never gonna stop me, never gonna stop
Never gonna stop me, never gonna stop
Never gonna stop me, never gonna stop

Yeah
The devil, ride a dinosaur
He paint the monster red so the blood don't stain the floor
In out, real savage show
Skorry as a shot came sickness, and watch it flow, yeah

Never gonna stop me, never gonna stop
Never gonna stop me, never gonna stop
Never gonna stop me, never gonna stop
Never gonna stop me, never gonna stop
Scream if you want it, cause I want more
Scream if you want it, cause I want more

Yeah
I'm on Durango, number 95
Take me to the home, kick boots and ultra live
See heaven flash a horror show
Knock it nice and smooth, step back and watch it flow, yeah

Never gonna stop me, never gonna stop
Never gonna stop me, never gonna stop
Never gonna stop me, never gonna stop
Never gonna stop me, never gonna stop

Scream if you want it, cause I want more
Scream if you want it, cause I want more4Embed
