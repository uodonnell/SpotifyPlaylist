Popular Song (Single Version) Lyrics
La-la, la-la

You were the popular one, the popular chick
It is what it is, now I'm popular-ish
Standin' on the field with your pretty pompom
Now you're workin' at the movies sellin' popular corn
I coulda been a mess, but I never went wrong
'Cause I'm puttin' down my story in a popular song (La-la, la-la)
Ah-ah, I said I'm puttin' down my story in a popular song

My problem, I never was a model
I never was a scholar, but you were always popular
You were singin' all the songs I don't know
Now you're in the front row 'cause my song is popular

Popular, I know about popular
It's not about who you are or your fancy car
You're only ever who you were
Popular, I know about popular
And all that you have to do is be true to you
That's all you ever need to know
So catch up 'cause you got an awful long way to go
So catch up 'cause you got an awful long way to go (Hey)

Always on the lookout for someone to hate
Pickin' on me like a dinner plate
You hid during classes and in-between 'em
Dunk me in the toilets, now it's you that cleans them
You tried to make me feel bad with the things you do
It ain't so funny when the joke's on you
Ooh, the joke's on you
Got everyone laughin', got everyone clappin', askin'
How come you look so cool?
'Cause that's the only thing that I learned at school, boy
Uh-huh, I said that's the only thing that I learned at school

My problem, I never was a model
I never was a scholar, but you were always popular
You were singin' all the songs I don't know
Now you're in the front row, 'cause my song is popular

Popular, I know about popular
It's not about who you are or your fancy car
You're only ever who you were
Popular, I know about popular
And all that you have to do is be true to you
That's all you ever need to know (That's all you ever need to know)
So catch up 'cause you got an awful long way to go
So catch up 'cause you got an awful long way to go

That's all you ever need to know
You're only ever who you were (Oh, baby)
That's all you ever need to know (Oh, baby)
You're only ever who you were (Hey, hey)
That's all you ever need to know (Ooh-ooh)
That's all you ever need to know

Popular, I know about popular
It's not about who you are or your fancy car
You're only ever who you were
Popular, I know about popular (That's all you ever need to know)
It's not about who you are or your fancy car
You're only ever who you were (That's all you ever need to know)
Popular, I know about popular (That's all you ever need to know)
And all that you have to do is be true to you
That's all you ever need to know
That's all you ever need to know32Embed
