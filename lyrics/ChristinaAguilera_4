Genie in a Bottle Lyrics
(Come on, come on, uh, yeah)
Oh-ooh, whoa-oh (Come on, come on, uh)

I feel like I've been locked up tight
For a century of lonely nights
Waiting for someone to release me
You're lickin' your lips and blowin' kisses my way
But that don't mean I'm gonna give it away
Baby, baby, baby (Baby, baby, baby)

Oh (My body's sayin', "Let's go")
Oh (But my heart is sayin', "No, no")

If you wanna be with me
Baby, there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle (In a bottle, baby)
You gotta rub me the right way (Yeah)
If you wanna be with me
I can make your wish come true
You gotta make a big impression (Oh yeah)
Gotta like what you do
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
You gotta rub me the right way, honey
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Come, come, come on and let me out

The music's bangin' and the lights down low
Just one more dance and then we're good to go
Waiting for someone who needs me
Hormones racin' at the speed of light
But that don't mean it's gotta be tonight (Yeah)
Baby, baby, baby (Baby, baby, baby)

Oh (My body's sayin', "Let's go")
Oh, ooh (Mm, but my heart is sayin' no, but my heart is sayin', "No, no")

If you wanna be with me
Baby, there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle (I'm a genie in a bottle)
You gotta rub me the right way (Oh yeah)
If you wanna be with me (Ooh)
I can make your wish come true (Your wish come true, oh)
Just come and set me free, baby
And I'll be with you
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
You gotta rub me the right way, honey
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Come, come, come on and let me out
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby (Mmm)
Gotta rub me the right way, honey (Mmm)
(If you wanna be with me)
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Come, come, come on and let me out

Oh (My body's sayin', "Let's go")
Oh (Mm, but my heart is sayin', "No, no")

If you wanna be with me
Baby, there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle (I'm a genie in a bottle)
You gotta rub me the right way (Whoa)
If you wanna be with me (Me)
I can make your wish come true (Ooh)
You gotta make a big impression
Gotta like what you do (Oh yeah-yeah)
If you wanna be with me (If you wanna be with me)
Baby, there's a price to pay (Uh, yeah)
I'm a genie in a bottle (In a bottle, baby)
You gotta rub me the right way (You gotta rub me the right way)
If you wanna be with me (If you wanna be with me, yeah)
I can make your wish come true
Just come and set me free, baby
And I'll be with you
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Come, come, come on and let me out19Embed
