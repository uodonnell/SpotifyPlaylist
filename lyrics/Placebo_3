Without You Iâ€™m Nothing Lyrics
Strange infatuation seems to grace the evening tide
I'll take it by your side
Such imagination seems to help the feeling slide
I'll take it by your side
Instant correlation sucks and breeds a pack of lies
I'll take it by your side
Oversaturation curls the skin and tans the hide
I'll take it by your side

Tick - tock
Tick - tock
Tick - tock
Tick - tick
Tick - tick
Tick - tock

I'm unclean, a libertine
And every time you vent your spleen
I seem to lose the power of speech
You're slipping slowly from my reach
You grow me like an evergreen
You've never seen the lonely me at all
I
Take the plan, spin it sideways
I
Fall

Without you, I'm nothing
Without you, I'm nothing
Without you, I'm nothing
(Take the plan, spin it sideways)
Without you, I'm nothing at all10Embed
