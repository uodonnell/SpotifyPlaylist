Say Something Lyrics
(Woah, woah, woah, woah, yeah)

We're a million miles apart in a thousand ways
Baby, you can light up the dark like a solar scape
And I can almost feel you coming and your heartbeat race
Someone, somebody, something, in the choice we make

I, I think about you
Woah, woah, woah, woah, yeah
(I can't help thinkin' 'bout ya)
(I'm always thinkin' 'bout ya)
Woah, woah, woah, woah, yeah
S-s-s-say something, say something
Tell me how you're feeling

Oh, we all got wanderlust in the darkest place
So we're going with our heart, yeah, it's all the rage
Oh, we're just, just tryin' to find ourselves in the storms we chase
Eh, eh, eh
Baby, in an endless summer, we can find our way

I, I think about you
Woah, woah, woah, woah, yeah
(I can't help thinkin' 'bout ya)
(I'm always thinkin' 'bout ya)
Woah, woah, woah, woah, yeah
S-s-s-say something, say something
Tell me how you're feeling
'Cause love is love, it never ends
Can we all be as one again?
'Cause love is love, it never ends
Can we all be as one again?
'Cause love is love, it never ends
Can we all be as one again?

'Cause love is love, it never ends (Woah, woah, woah, woah, yeah)
Can we all be as one again?
'Cause love is love, it never ends (Woah, woah, woah, woah, yeah)
Can we all be as one again? (Say, say, say something)
'Cause love is love, it never ends (Woah, woah, woah, woah, yeah)
Can we all be as one again? (Say something)
'Cause love is love, it never ends (Woah, woah, woah, woah, yeah)
Can we all be as one again? (Say, say, say something)
'Cause love is love, it never ends
Can we all be as one again?
'Cause love is love, it never ends
Can we all be as one again?20Embed
