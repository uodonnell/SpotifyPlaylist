Not My Ex Lyrics
My ex used to tell me I'm flawless
When laying low with other girls
Believed him when he said he was honest
Then blamed myself when I got hurt
My ex used to tell me I'm selfish
But never did he put me first
Ignore me and he'd do it on purpose
Just to have the last word

But now you wanna love me, who knows what you'll find
It won't be easy, but I'm down for the ride
Just remember
You're not my ex, no
I know I can be troubled, Lord knows that it's hard
It won't be simple when I give you my heart
Just remember
I'm not your ex

I'm falling for you, you're falling for me
I won't promise I won't hurt again
I can promise we won't be like them
I'm falling for you, you're falling for me
I won't promise I won't walk away
I can promise it won't be the same
My ex used to tell me "No male friends
Cut them off if you really care"
I would go away, couple days, hundred girls at his place
Games night, truth or dare, ha
My ex used to tell me he's so chill
Then steal my phone, so I couldn't leave, yes
Act a clown, run his mouth, cussing out, put me down
Thank God, I set me free

'Cause now you wanna love me, who knows what you'll find (Mm)
It won't be easy, but I'm down for the ride
Just remember
You're not my ex (Mm, mm)
I know I can be troubled, Lord knows that it's hard
It won't be simple and when I give you my heart
Just remember
I'm not your ex (Yes)

I'm falling for you, you're falling for me
I won't promise I won't hurt again
I can promise we won't be like them
I'm falling for you, you're falling for me
I won't promise I won't walk away
I can promise it won't be the same
No, oh, oh, yeah
It won't be the same (Yeah)
It won't be the same (No, no)
It wonâ€™t be the same
I'm falling for you, you are falling for me (You are)
I won't promise I won't hurt again
I can promise we won't be like them (Your ex)
And I'm not your ex
You're not my ex
You're not my ex
Mmm, mmm, mmm1Embed
