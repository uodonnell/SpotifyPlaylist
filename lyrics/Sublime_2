Doin’ Time Lyrics
Summertime, and the livin's easy
Bradley's on the microphone with Ras M.G.​
All people in the dance will agree
That we're well-qualified to represent the L.B.C.​
And me and Louie, we gon' run to the party
Dance to the rhythm, it gets harder
(And we can do it like this, in the place to be)

Me and my girl, we got this relationship
I love her so bad, but she treats me like sh…
On lockdown, like a penitentiary
She spreads her lovin' all over
And when she gets home, there's none left for me

Summertime, and the livin's easy
Bradley's on the microphone with Ras M.G.​
All people in the dance will agree
That we're well-qualified to represent the L.B.C.​
Me, me and Louie, we gon' run to the party
Dance to the rhythm, it gets harder
(And we can do it like this, in the place to be)

Oh, take this veil from off my eyes
My burning sun will, some day, rise
So, what am I gonna be doin' for a while?
Said, I'm gonna play with myself
Show them, now, we've come off the shelf
So what?
Summertime, and the livin's easy
Bradley's on the microphone with Ras M.G.​
All people in the dance will agree
That we're well-qualified to represent the L.B.C.​
G, we and Louie, run to the party
Dance to the rhythm, it gets harder
(And we can do it like this, in the place to be)

Evil, I've come to tell you that she's evil, most definitely
Evil, ornery, scandalous and evil, most definitely
The tension, it's getting hotter
I'd like to hold her head underwater

Me and my girl
We've got a relationship
Me and my girl, mmm
We got a relationship, mmm-hmm
My girl
We got a relationship, oh
And my girl
Got a relationship
Take a tip, take a tip
Take a ti-ti-ti-tip from me
Bradley's on the microphone with Ras M.G.​
All people in the dance will agree
That we're well-qualified to represent the L.B.C.​
Me, la-la-Louie
While everybody run to the rhythm, it gets harder
(And we can do it like this, in the place to be)
Summertime, and the livin's easy29Embed
