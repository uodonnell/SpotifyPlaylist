1,2,3,4 Lyrics
One, two, one, two, three, four
Give me more loving than I've ever had
Make it all better when I'm feeling sad
Tell me that I'm special even when I know I'm not
Make it feel good when I hurt so bad
Barely gettin' mad
I'm so glad I found you
I love being around you
You make it easy
It's as easy as one, two, one, two, three, four
There's only one thing (one) to do (two)
Three words (three) for you... (four)
I love you (I love you)
There's only one way (one) to say (two)
Those three words (three) and that's what I'll do... (four)
I love you (I love you)
Give me more loving from the very start
Piece me back together when I fall apart
Tell me things you never even tell your closest friends
Make it feel good when I hurt so bad
Best that I've had
I'm so glad I found you
I love being around you
You make it easy
It's as easy as one, two, one, two, three, four
There's only one thing (one) to do (two)
Three words (three) for you... (four)
I love you (I love you)
There's only one way (one) to say (two)
Those three words (three) and that's what I'll do... (four)
I love you (I love you)
I love you (I love you)

You make it easy

It's as easy as one, two, one, two, three, four
There's only one thing (one) to do (two)
Three words (three) for you... (four)
I love you (I love you)
There's only one way (one) to say (two)
Those three words (three) and that's what I'll do... (four)
I love you (I love you)
I love you (I love you)

One, two, three, four
I love you
(I love you) I love you10Embed
