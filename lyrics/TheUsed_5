Pretty Handsome Awkward Lyrics
Kickin' it out! (Out, out, out)

Your dream vacation
Is my hostage refuge
A work in progress
You bleed just like you puke while running a mile
I beg to differ
Make me an offer
Warm summer rain
You bleed just like you puke while running a mile
(Running a mile)

Hey, are you okay?
You look pretty low
Very handsome awkward
Do you feel okay?
You look pretty low
Very handsome awkward

Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah! Handsome awkward
Your market value
Your resurrection (Your resurrection)
Your shallow concept
Help yourself, I hope you choke and you die
I know you meant it
Nice fucking disguise, so hollow
Embrace the burn
You bleed just like you puke while running a mile

Hey, are you okay? (Okay?)
You look pretty low
Very handsome awkward
Do you feel okay? (Okay?)
You look pretty low
Very handsome awkward

You look pretty low
You look pretty low

Your dream vacation
Is my hostage refuge
A work in progress
You bleed just like you puke while running a mile
I beg to differ
Make me an offer
Warm summer rain
You bleed just like you puke while running a mile
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah! Handsome awkward

Hey, are you okay? (Okay?)
You look pretty low
Very handsome awkward
Do you feel okay? (Okay?)
You look pretty low
Very handsome awkward
Hey, are you okay? (Okay?)
You look pretty low, pretty low, pretty low
Pretty handsome awkward
Do you feel okay?
You look pretty low, pretty low, pretty low
(Handsome awkward)
Pretty handsome awkward

Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Kickin' it out (Yeah! Yeah!)
Out (Yeah! Yeah!)
Kickin' it out (Yeah! Yeah!)
(Yeah!) Yeah, kick this out
Kickin' it out!2Embed
