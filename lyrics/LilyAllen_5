Sheezus Lyrics
Been here before, so I'm prepared
Not gonna lie, though; I'm kinda scared
Lace up my gloves, I'm going in
Don't let my kids watch me when I get in the ring
I'll take the hits, roll with the punches
I'll get back up, it's not as if I've never done this
But, then again, the game is changing
Can't just come back, jump on the mic, and do the same thing
There goes the bell, I know that sound
I guess it's time for me to go another round
Oh, wish me luck, I'm gonna need it
I'll see you on the other side if I'm still breathing

RiRi isn't scared of Katy Perry's roaring
Queen B's going back to the drawing
Lorde smells blood, yeah, she's about to slay you
Kid ain't one to fuck with when she's only on her debut
We're all watching Gaga, LOL like haha
Dying for the art, so really, she's a martyr
And second best will never cut it for the divas
Give me that crown, bitch
I wanna be Sheezus

I'm ready for all the comparisons
I think it's dumb, and it's embarrassing
I'm switching off, no longer listening
I've had enough of persecution and conditioning
Maybe it's an instinct, we're only animal
Maybe it's healthy, maybe it's rational
It makes me angry, I'm serious
But, then again, I'm just about to get my period (Whoa!)
Periods, we all get periods
Every month, yo, that's what the theory is
It's human nature, another cycle
Be nice to me, I'll make you one of my disciples
RiRi isn't scared of Katy Perry's roaring
Queen B's going back to the drawing
Lorde smells blood, yeah, she's about to slay you
Kid ain't one to fuck with when she's only on her debut
We're all watching Gaga, LOL like haha
Dying for the art, so really, she's a martyr
And second best will never cut it for the divas
Give me that crown, bitch
I wanna be Sheezus

I am born again
Now run along and tell all of your friends
To come and join us
Give yourselves to me, I am your leader
Let me be Sheezus, let me be Sheezus
I am born again
Now run along and tell all of your friends
To come and join us
Give yourselves to me, I am your leader
Let me be Sheezus42Embed
