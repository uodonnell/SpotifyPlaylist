No Lie Lyrics
Feel your eyes, they all over me
Don't be shy, take control of me
Get the vibe, it's gonna be lit tonight

Baby girl, yuh ah carry ten ton a phatness, gimme some a dat (Gimme dat)
Mixed wid di badness, look how she hot (Gyal, yuh hot)
Shaped like goddess, but a nah jus dat
Is a good piece a mentals under di cap (Ha)
Hot piece of game an' mi love how yuh trod (Stepper)
Watching every step a di pepper deh weh yuh got (Pepper)
Stayin' in my brain, memory nah detach (Memo')
Mainly my aim is to give yuh this love

Hypnotic, the way you move
Let me acknowledge the way you do
And I would not lie, baby, you
Beam me up like Scotty (Baby girl)
It's so hypnotic, the way you move
That's why I wanted to get to you
And I would not lie, baby, you
Move so hypnotic

No li-i-i-ie
Gyal, we never miss
Feel your eyes, they all over me
Don't be shy, take control of me
Get the vibe, it's gonna be lit tonight
Gyal, we never miss, gyal, we never miss
