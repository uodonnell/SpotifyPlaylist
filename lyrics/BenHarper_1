Walk Away LyricsOh no, here comes that sun again
That means another day without you my friend
And it hurts me to look into the mirror at myself
And it hurts even more to have to be with somebody else
And it's so hard to do and so easy to say
But sometimes, sometimes you just have to walk away
Walk away
So many people to love in my life
Why do I worry about one
But you put the happy in my ness
You put the good times into my fun
And it's so hard to do and so easy to say
But sometimes, sometimes you just have to walk away
Walk away
And head for the door
We've tried the goodbyes
So many days
We walk in the same direction
So that we could never stray
They say if you love somebody
Then you have got to set them free
But I would rather be locked to you than live in this pain and misery
They say that time, will make all this go away
But it's time that has taken my tomorrows and turned them into yesterdays
And once again that rising sun is a droppin on down
And once again you my friend are no where to be found
And it's so hard to do and so easy to say
But sometimes, sometimes you just have to walk away
Walk away
And head for the door
You just walk away
Walk away
Walk away
Just walk on
Walk on
Turn and head for the door
Walk awayEmbed
