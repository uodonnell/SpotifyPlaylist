All These Things That Iâ€™ve Done Lyrics
When there's nowhere else to run
Is there room for one more son?
One more son
If you can, hold on
If you can, hold on, hold on
I wanna stand up, I wanna let go
You know, you know; no, you don't, you don't
I wanna shine on in the hearts of man
I want a meaning from the back of my broken hand

Another head aches, another heart breaks
I'm so much older than I can take
And my affection, well, it comes and goes
I need direction to perfection, no, no, no, no

Help me out, yeah
You know you got to help me out, yeah
Oh, don't you put me on the back burner
You know you got to help me out, yeah

And when there's nowhere else to run
Is there room for one more son?
These changes ain't changing me
The cold-hearted boy I used to be
Yeah, you know you got to help me out, yeah
Oh, don't you put me on the back burner
You know you got to help me out, yeah
You're gonna bring yourself down, yeah
You're gonna bring yourself down, yeah
You're gonna bring yourself down

I got soul but I'm not a soldier
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
(Time, truth, and hearts)

Yeah, you know you got to help me out, yeah
Oh, don't you put me on the back burner
You know you got to help me out, yeah
You're gonna bring yourself down, yeah
You're gonna bring yourself down, yeah
Oh, don't you put me on the back burner
You're gonna bring yourself down, yeah
You're gonna bring yourself down
Over and in (You're gonna bring yourself down)
Last call for sin (Bring yourself down)
While everyone's lost, the battle is won
With all these things that I've done
All these things that I've done
(Time, truth, and hearts)
If you can hold on
If you can hold on49Embed
