Low Lyrics
If you wanna talk to me yeah
Know that I am plain to see yeah, yeah
Yeah...
I don't want this fame to be
Staining my reality, yeah
Yeah...

Don't lift me up
To tear me down
I just want a lover
Baby stay with me on the ground
Drop with me, let me go
Got to keep it low
Drop with me, let me go
Got to keep it low
Don't lift me up
To tear me down
I just want a lover
Baby stay with me on the ground
Drop with me, let me go
Got to keep it low
Drop with me, let me go
Got to keep it low, whooo
If you bought the fantasy
It's murder in the first degree, yeah
Yeah...
Is my sexuality
Creating such a tragedy? yeah
Yeah...

Don't lift me up
To tear me down
I just want a lover
Baby stay with me on the ground
Drop with me, let me go
Got to keep it low
Drop with me, let me go
Got to keep it low
Don't lift me up
To tear me down
I just want a lover
Baby stay with me on the ground
Drop with me, let me go
Got to keep it low
Drop with me, let me go
Got to keep it low, whooo
I'm so tired of playing this crazy game
Someone's always left out in the rain
Is there a chance that we can make it, uh
Just keep it real 'cause we can't fake it, yeah, whooo

'Cause you and I can't take this anymore
We've got to keep our feet right on the floor
There's no more secrets, no more lying
Baby I'm really, really trying
To get to love

Don't lift me up
To tear me down
I just want a lover
Baby stay with me on the ground
Drop with me, let me go
Got to keep it low
Drop with me, let me go
Got to keep it low
Don't lift me up
To tear me down
I just want a lover, whooo
Baby stay with me on the ground
Drop with me, let me go
Got to keep it low
Drop with me, let me go
Got to keep it low
Don't lift me up
To tear me down
I just want a lover
Baby stay with me on (whooo) the ground
Drop with me, let me go
Got to keep it low
Drop with me, let me go
Got to keep it low
Don't lift me up
To tear me down
I just want a lover, whooo
I just want a lover right now
Drop with me, let me go
Got to keep it low
Drop with me, let me go
Got to keep it low, whoohooo4Embed
