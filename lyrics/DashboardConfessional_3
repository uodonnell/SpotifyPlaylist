We Fight Lyrics
We were the kids that left home probably too young
But we took our share and maybe then some
Tired of beatings and battles and being sewn up
But that made us grow up, and that made 'em scared

'Cause we never learned to keep our voices down
No, we only learned to shout
So we fight our way in (we fight our way in)
And we fight our way out
And we earned what we could from the ground up
And tried to lift the whole damn crowd up
So we fight our way in (we fight our way in)
And we fight our way out

(We fight our way in) We fight our way in
(And we fight our way out) And we fight our way out
(We fight our way in) We fight our way in
(And we fight our way out) And we fight our way out

And there's still a kid somewhere that needs to hear this
That somebody cares, that somebody knows
Who's tired of bleeding and battered and being torn up
Just pick yourself up, it's time to go
'Cause we never learned to keep our voices down
No, we only learned to shout
So we fight our way in (we fight our way in)
And we fight our way out
And we earned what we could from the ground up
And tried to lift the whole damn crowd up
So we fight our way in (we fight our way in)
And we fight our way out

(We fight our way in) We fight our way in
(And we fight our way out) And we fight our way out
(We fight our way in) We fight our way in
(And we fight our way out) And we fight our way out

Maybe we found a way to make some tracks
We didn't snicker and turn our backs
We just keep digging in, and digging in, and giving back

'Cause we never learned to keep our voices down
No, we only learned to shout
So we fight our way in (we fight our way in)
And we fight our way out
And we earned what we could from the ground up
And tried to lift the whole damn crowd up
So we fight our way in (we fight our way in)
And we fight our way out
'Cause we never learned to keep our voices down
No, we only learned to shout
So we fight our way in (we fight our way in)
And we fight our way out

(We fight our way in) We fight our way in
(And we fight our way out) And we fight our way out
(We fight our way in) We fight our way in
(And we fight our way out) And we fight our way out1Embed
