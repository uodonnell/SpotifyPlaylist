Holly Wood Died Lyrics
Accidents out on the highway to somewhere
They tell us about when we're young
Rescuers working to clean up the crashes
Before she can see what they've done
Nobody told her she'd lose in the first round
The last fight was fixed from the start
Names on her sidewalks, they move through her body
Like razors, they cut through her heart
Like razors, they cut through her heart

Hey, let go of all you know
And you're flying away now
What have you got to lose?
And say out loud these words I've found
I'll be there when you come down
I'll be waiting for you

Night life, the high life, she just wants a good life
So someone remembers her too
But somewhere she heard there was some place to go
When you die, when you live like we do
Die when you live like we do
Hey, let go of all you know
And you're flying away now
What have you got to lose?
And say out loud these words I've found
I'll be there when you come down
I'll be waiting for you

Hey, let go of all you know
And you're flying away now
What have you got to lose?
And say out loud these words I've found
I'll be there when you come down
I'll be waiting for you
Hey, let go of all you know
And you're flying away now
What have you got to lose?
And say out loud these words I've found
I'll be there when you come down
I'll be waiting for you6Embed
