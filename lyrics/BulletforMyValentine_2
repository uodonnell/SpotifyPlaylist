Letting You Go Lyrics
I don't understand just why you wanna keep me guessing
What I've done or what I've said to make, make you feel this way
I get the feeling this is never getting any better

Seems to me we need to draw a line for everybody's sake
Before it washes us away

First you wanna hate me, then you wanna love me
This is how I'm feeling, I'm just letting you know
Don't wanna hear it, I ain't gonna fake it
This is how I'm feeling, now I'm letting you go
Coldest heart I've ever known, now I'm better off alone
First you wanna love me, then you wanna hate me
This is how I'm feeling now I'm letting you, letting you go

So I know this hasn't gone the way that we expected
You had to try and make a fool of me and leave a bitter taste
I try to compromise with open eyes but we're disconnected

Seems to me we need to draw a line for everybody's sake
Before it washes us away
(First you wanna hate me)
First you wanna hate me, then you wanna love me
This is how I'm feeling, I'm just letting you know
Don't wanna hear it, I ain't gonna fake it
This is how I'm feeling, now I'm letting you go
Coldest heart I've ever known, now I'm better off alone
First you wanna love me, then you wanna hate me
This is how I'm feeling now I'm letting you, letting you go

Now I'm letting you, letting you go
Now I'm letting you, letting you go

First you wanna hate me, then you wanna love me
This is how I'm feeling, I'm just letting you know
Don't wanna hear it, I ain't gonna fake it
This is how I'm feeling, now I'm letting you go
Coldest heart I've ever known, now I'm better off alone
First you wanna love me, then you wanna hate me
This is how I'm feeling now I'mâ€”
First you wanna hate me, then you wanna love me
This is how I'm feeling, I'm just letting you know
Don't wanna hear it, I ain't gonna fake it
This is how I'm feeling, now I'm letting you go
Coldest heart I've ever known
Now I'm better off alone
First you wanna love me
Then you wanna hate me
This is how I'm feeling now I'm letting you, letting you go3Embed
