Echoes Lyrics
Send out a sound for the wood between the worlds
Gently repeat as the boundaries start to swirl
Keep to the call that is twice now liminal
It's not the same where the trails lead to the outer regions

Echoes from the otherworld turn horizons into endless ever-present
Echoes, many otherworlds, true horizon start to turn

Numberless names with the force of the ninth wave
Keep to the call that's repeated in the outer regions

Echoes from the otherworld turn horizons into endless ever-present
Echoes, many otherworlds, true horizon takes a turn
Echoes reflect and change, they serenade
Echoes reflect and change, they serenade

Echoes from the otherworld turn horizons into endless ever-present
Echoes, many otherworlds, true horizon makes the endless ever-present
Echoes into otherworlds, true horizons into endless ever present
Echoes, many otherworlds, true horizon stops to turn
Echoes reflect and change, they serenade
Echoes reflect and change, they serenade
They serenade1Embed
