Lonely Lyrics
Lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely
I have nobody for my own
Oh, I'm so lonely
I'm Mr. Lonely
I'm Mr. Lonely
I have nobody for my own
Oh, I'm so lonely

Yo, this one here goes out
To all my players out there, man
You know, that got that one good girl, dawg
That's always been there, man
Like, took all the bullshit
But then one day she can't take it no more
And decides to leave me

Yeah, I woke up in the middle of the night
And I noticed my girl wasn't by my side
Could've sworn I was dreamin'
For her I was feenin'
So I had to take a little ride
Backtrackin' on these few years
Tryin' to figure out what I do to make it go bad
‘Cause ever since my girl left me
My whole life came crashin', and I'm so…
Lonely (So lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (To call my own, girl)
Oh, I'm so lonely (So lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (To call my own, girl)
Oh, I'm so lonely

Can't believe I had a girl like you
And I just let you walk right out of my life
After all I put you through
You still stuck around and stayed by my side
What really hurt me is I broke your heart
Baby, you a good girl and I had no right
I really wanna make things right
‘Cause without you in my life, girl, I'm so…

Lonely (So lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (To call my own, girl)
Oh, I'm so lonely (So lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (To call my own, baby)
Oh, I'm so lonely
Been all about the world
Ain't never met a girl
That could take the things that you been through
Never thought the day would come
Where you would get up and run
And I would be out chasin' you
‘Cause ain't nowhere in the globe I'd rather be
Ain't no one in the globe I'd rather see
Than the girl of my dreams that made me be
So happy, but now so lonely

Lonely (So lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (To call my own, girl)
Oh, I'm so lonely (So lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (To call my own, girl)
Oh, I'm so lonely

Never thought that I'd be alone
I didn't think you'd be gone this long
I just want you to call my phone
So stop playin', girl, and come on home
Baby girl, I didn't mean to shout
I want me and you to work it out
I never wished that I would ever hurt my baby
And it's drivin' me crazy, ‘cause I'm so…
Lonely (So lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (To call my own, girl)
Oh, I'm so lonely (so lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (To call my own, girl)
Oh, I'm so lonely

So lonely (Lonely), so lonely (So lonely)
Mr. Lonely (Lonely), so lonely (So lonely)
So lonely (Lonely), so lonely (So lonely)
So lonely, Mr. Lonely68Embed
