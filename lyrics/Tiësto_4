Carry You Home Lyrics
Everybody needs a little room to make mistakes
You don't have to be so perfect, you can go at your own pace

Just show me the real you so that I can feel you
I promise I won't let you down
Just show me the real you so that I can feel you
I promise I won't let you down

Let me carry you home
Let me carry you home
When you're tired and you're weary
And you have no strength to go on
Let me carry you home
Let me carry you home
When there's no one to turn to
And all you've had faith in is gone
Let me carry you home

Let me carry you home
Let me carry you home

Everyone deserves a little precious time
To stumble till they find a little peace of mind
Just show me the real you so that I can feel you
I promise I won't let you down
Just show me the real you so that I can feel you
I promise I won't let you down

Let me carry you home
Let me carry you home
When you're tired and you're weary
And you have no strength to go on
Let me carry you home
Let me carry you home
When there's no one to turn to
And all you've had faith in is gone
Let me carry you home

Let me carry you home

Let me carry you home
Let me carry you home
When there's no one to turn to
And all you've had faith in is gone
Let me carry you home4Embed
