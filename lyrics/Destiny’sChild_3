Dangerously in Love Lyrics
I love you
I love you, I love you

Baby, I love you, you are my life
My happiest moments were incomplete if you weren't by my side
You're my relation, in connection to the sun
With you next to me, there's no darkness I can't overcome
You are my raindrops, I am the seed
With you, and God who's my sunlight, I bloom and grow so beautifully
Baby, I'm so proud, proud to be your girl
You make the confusion go all away from this cold and messed up world

I am in love with you, you set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave, just, just keep loving me
The way I love you, loving me
'Cause I am in love with you, you set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave, just keep loving me
The way I love you, loving me
And I know you love me, love me for who I am
'Cause years before I became who I am, baby, you were my man
Know it ain't easy, easy loving me
I appreciate the love and dedication from you to me
Later on in my destiny, I see myself having your child
I see myself being your wife, and I see my whole future in your eyes
Thought of all my love for you sometimes makes me wanna cry
Realize all my blessings, I'm grateful to have you by my side

I am in love with you, you set me free (I am in love)
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me (Do this thing)
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you (Without you)
I'll never leave just, just keep loving me (I love you)
The way I love you, loving me
'Cause I am in love with you, you set me free (I'm so in love)
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me (Life without you)
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you (No, no, no, no)
I'll never leave, just keep loving me
The way I love you, loving me

Every time I see your face, my heart smiles
Every time it feels so good, it hurts sometimes
Created in this world to love, to hold, to feel, to breathe, to live you
Dangerously in love
I am in love with you, you set me free (Yeah)
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me (Can't do this thing, yeah)
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you (I love you, I love you, I love you, I'll never leave)
I'll never leave, just, just keep loving me (Oh, no)
The way I love you, loving me
'Cause I am in love with you, you set me free (I'm in love with you, I'm in love with you)
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me (I cannot do it, I cannot do anything without you in my life)
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you (Holding me)
I'll never leave, just keep loving me (Kissing me)
The way I love you, loving me (Loving me dangerously)

Dangerous, dangerously in love with you
Oh, I love you
I love, I love, I love, I love, I love you
I love you, oh yes
I love you, ooh
I love, I love, I love you, in love with lovin' you
Love you
I love you
I love you, I love you
I love you
