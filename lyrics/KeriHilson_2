Pretty Girl Rock Lyrics
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, ah
Uh, uh, uh
I do the pretty girl rock, rock, rock
Do the pretty girl rock, rock, rock
Now what's your name?

My name is Keri, I'm so very
Fly, oh my, it's a little bit scary
Boys wanna marry, looking at my derrière
You can stare, but if you touch it, I'ma bury
Pretty as a picture (Hey)
Sweeter than a swisher (Hey)
Mad 'cause I'm cuter than the girl that's with ya (Hey)
I ain't gotta talk about it, baby, you can see it (See it)
But if you want, I'll be happy to repeat it

My name is Keri, I'm so very (Hey, hey)
Fly, oh my, it's a little bit scary (Hey)
Boys wanna marry, looking at my derrière (Hey, hey)
You can stare but if you touch it I'mma bury
Pretty as a picture (Picture)
Sweeter than a swisher (Swisher)
Mad 'cause I'm cuter than the girl that's with ya
I can talk about it 'cause I know that I'm pretty
And if you know it too, then ladies sing it with me
All eyes on me when I walk in
No question that this girl's a ten
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful
My walk, my talk, the way I drip
It's not my fault, so please don't trip
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful (Hey!)

Aye, now do the pretty girl rock, rock, rock
Do the pretty girl rock, rock, rock
Do the pretty girl rock, rock
All my ladies do the pretty girl rock, rock, rock
Do the pretty girl rock, rock, rock
Do the pretty girl rock, rock, rock
Do the pretty girl rock
Now where you at?

If you're looking for me you can catch me (Hot spot)
Cameras flashing, daddy turned his head as soon as I passed him (Hmm)
Girls think I'm conceited 'cause I know I'm attractive
Don't worry about what I think, why don't you ask him? (Oh-oh-oh)
Get yourself together don't hate (Never do it)
Jealousy's the ugliest trait (Don't ever do it)
I can talk about it 'cause I know that I'm pretty
And if you know it too, then ladies sing it with me
All eyes on me when I walk in
No question that this girl's a ten
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful
My walk, my talk, the way I drip
It's not my fault, so please don't trip
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful

Doing the pretty girl rock, rock, rock
Do the pretty girl rock, rock, rock
Do the pretty girl rock, rock, rock
Do the pretty girl rock, rock
All my ladies do the pretty girl rock, rock
Get along with your pretty girl rock, rock, rock
Still show me your pretty girl rock, rock, rock
All my ladies do the pretty girl rock, rock, rock
Sing it with me now

All eyes on me when I walk in (When I walk in, yeah)
No question that this girl's a ten (Oh-oh)
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful (Oh-oh)
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful
My walk, my talk, the way I drip
It's not my fault, so please don't trip (Please don't trip, no)
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful (Beautiful)
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful (You're beautiful, yeah)
All eyes on me when I walk in (Ooh)
No question that this girl's a ten (Don't hate me)
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful (Don't hate her 'cause she's)
My walk, my talk, the way I drip (Oh, beautiful)
It's not my fault, so please don't trip (You're beautiful)
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful (You're beautiful)
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful (Oh-ooh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)28Embed
