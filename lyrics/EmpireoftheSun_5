Way to Go Lyrics
Surfing the snow
Are you ready for
A revolution to show the way
Seven more weeks until the day

Because heartbreak's coming to bend us the wrong way
Praise us, memory will change it into old things

Doesn't matter what's tripping you out, there's ways to go
This is where we get carried away enough to start again

While hearts beat
It's nothing like before
Dreaming is the home of the brave
Future is the healing of pain

Because heartbreak's coming to bend us the wrong way
Praise us, memory will change it into old things

Doesn't matter what's tripping you out, there's ways to go
This is where we get carried away enough to start again
Doesn't matter what's tripping you out, there's ways to go
This is where we get carried away enough to start again
Like a cannonball shot across the floor
We have found a way through the darkest hour
Like a cannonball shot across the floor
We have little time for worry

Doesn't matter what's tripping you out, there's ways to go
This is where we get carried away enough to start again
Doesn't matter what's tripping you out, there's ways to go
This is where we get carried away enough to start again
Doesn't matter what's tripping you out, there's ways to go
This is where we get carried away enough to start again3Embed
