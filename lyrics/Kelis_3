Bossy Lyrics
Ayo
You don't have to love me
You don't even have to like me
But you will respect me
You know why?
'Cause I'm a boss
Uh, uh, watch that thing go
Uh, uh, watch that thing go (Bangladesh)
Uh, uh, watch that thing go
Uh, uh, watch that thing go

I'm bossy, I'm the first girl to scream on a track
I switched up the beat of the drum
That's right, I brought all the boys to the yard
And that's right, I'm the one that's tattooed on his arm
I'm bossy, I'm the bitch y'all love to hate
I'm the chick that's raised the stake
I told Young Stunna he should switch to BAPE
I'm back with an 808 'cause I'm bossy

Ooh, let me slow it down so you can catch the flow
Screw it up, make it go extra slow
Real girls get down on the floor
(On the floor, get down on the floor)
Ooh, I gave you a taste, you want some more?
Touch down on me, throw it up like a pro
I ride the beat like a bicycle, I'm icy cold
Ooh, from the 6-4 hoppers up in Crenshaw
The money makin' playas up in Harlem
Don't want no problem
We gon' keep it bumpin while the 808 is jumpin'
Diamonds on my neck, di-diamonds on my grill
Diamonds on my neck, di-diamonds on my grill

I'm bossy, I'm the first girl to scream on a track
I switched up the beat of the drum
That's right, I brought all the boys to the yard
And that's right, I'm the one that's tattooed on his arm
I'm bossy, I'm the bitch y'all love to hate
I'm the chick that's raised the stake
I told Young Stunna he should switch to BAPE
I'm back with an 808 'cause I'm bossy

Ooh, bet ya never heard it like this before
Me and my baby be closin' them Phantom doors
Bar poppin' ish that you can't afford
Can't afford
Ooh, I'm chokin'
Blastin' the clouds, it's all smokin'
All the while I'm all open
Me and my girls, we stay fly and I love to stay high
Ooh, from the 6-4 hoppers up in Crenshaw
The money makin' playas up in Harlem
Don't want no problem
We gon' keep it bumpin while the 808 is jumpin'
Diamonds on my neck, di-diamonds on my grill
Diamonds on my neck, di-diamonds on my grill

I'm bossy, I'm the first girl to scream on a track
I switched up the beat of the drum
That's right, I brought all the boys to the yard
And that's right, I'm the one that's tattooed on his arm
I'm bossy, I'm the bitch y'all love to hate
I'm the chick that's raised the stake
I told Young Stunna he should switch to BAPE
I'm back with an 808 'cause I'm bossy

It's 'bout time that she get with me
Can't stop starin', she's fine and she's pretty
Damn girl, don't hurt 'em
If niggas don't back that, you gon work 'em
Put your mack down, I know your background
What you want, girl? You gettin' that now
That's how you do it, huh? Well, I'm the coolest one
In fact, bitches in the back, bring 'em to the front
Bitch, tell that man you's a boss bitch
Make some noise, raise your hand if you's a boss bitch
I don't think he understands you's a boss bitch
Get some help if you can cause he lost it
Ain't no refunds, she spent the cash, man
In your Benz with her friends in the fast lane
Flossin', you say "How much it cost me?"
About a million dollars, playa, she's bossy
I'm bossy, I'm the first girl to scream on a track
I switched up the beat of the drum
That's right, I brought all the boys to the yard
And that's right, I'm the one that's tattooed on his arm
I'm bossy, I'm the bitch y'all love to hate
I'm the chick that's raised the stake
I told Young Stunna he should switch to BAPE
I'm back with an 808 'cause I'm bossy

Uh, uh, watch that thing go
Uh, uh, watch that thing go
Uh, uh, watch that thing go
Uh, uh, watch that thing go
Uh, uh, watch that thing go
Uh, uh, watch that thing go
Uh, uh, watch that thing go
Uh, uh, watch that thing go
Uh, uh11Embed
