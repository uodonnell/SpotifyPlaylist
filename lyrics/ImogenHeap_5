The Happy Song Lyrics
Bring! Bring! On the bicycle
Beep! Beep! In the car
Ping! Ping! A submarine
Phew! Phew! helicopter
A choo-choo train
An aeroplane
A "wee!" down the slide

I just adore-dore-dore
You every day more
Wherever we are

So up in the sky
And deep in the ocean
Through valleys and hills
Away we go

Bring! Bring! On the bicycle
Beep! Beep! In the car
Ping! Ping! A submarine
Phew! Phew! helicopter
A choo-choo train
An aeroplane
A rocket to the stars!
There's a dance-dance-dance
Going on in my heart
Wherever we are

So up in the sky
And deep in the ocean
Through valleys and hills
Away we go

You little monkey, you're staying up late
Who purrs like a cat when they get their own way
Who then turns into a lion
Who lets out a... RAWR!

I love-love-love
You every day more
Whatever's in store

Woah, up in the sky
And deep in the ocean
Through valleys and hills
Away we go
Up in the sky
And deep in the ocean
Through valleys and hills
Away we go1Embed
