Revenge Lyrics
Mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm

Like Leo in The Revenant
Abel in that Bible bit
Revenge is sweet, isn't it?
Really, really hope for it
I know that it won't fix a thing
A song like this that I could sing for you
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)
All the feels you make me do
A nightmare fuckin' comin' true
I wish I was a lawyer
I would sue you
Sue you, take your dog
Take your house, take your shoes
Take your heart (Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)
And now here comes that singin' part

I'm daydreamin' (Daydreamin')
Let me count the ways (Let me count the ways)
How I'll get you (How I'll get you)
Or how I'll make you pay (You pay)
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)
Babe, I'm hurtin' (I'm hurtin')
And now you'll feel the same (Feel the same)
That's my plan (That's my plan), that's my plan, that's my plan
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)
We could do revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge together, together, together
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)
We could do revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge together, together, together (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet (Now, now)

Now here's where girlfriends come in hand
Especially those that understand
Crime's a crime, but listen, man
Really cannot give a damn
We've all been through this kind of thing
Say the word, we make it sting for him
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)
He can't just get away with it
Eye for eye, you piece of sh—
You treat us like a garbage pit
Let me at him, wait for it
Wait for it, wait for it (Wait for it)
Here's that singin' part again
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm, yeah)
I'm daydreamin' (I'm daydreamin')
Let me count the ways (Let me count the ways)
How I'll get you (How I'll get you)
Or how I'll make you pay (You pay)
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)
Babe, I'm hurtin' (I'm hurtin')
And now you'll feel the same (Feel the same)
That's my plan, that's my plan, that's my plan
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)

We could do revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge together, together, together
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet (Oh-oh, revenge is sweet)
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)
We could do revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge together, together, together (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet (Revenge is sweet)

Well, in the beginning we
Felt like we was meant to be
I fell for you and skinned my knee
But hell, with any injury
Eventually you'll get up gingerly
Feels like it'll take a century
To heal, but just know that I will
(Mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm)
But fuck tryna make amends
I'd rather take revenge
You're stickin' safety pins inside my atrium
Your day begins at 8 p.m.
You hit the ATM
In my Mercedes Benz
With all your lady
Friends—whores!
Hit the club and you go out
Don't know a sum, 'cause when I calculate
The times you cheated
And I total up all the amounts
It doesn't add up
'Cause you say that just givin' out your number doesn't count
Get it? (I hate you)
Then see me with someone new
Get mad and flip it, look how bad you spin it
First you turn your back on me
Then tell me that I stabbed you in it?!
Stabbed you in it, stabbed you in it
Stabbed you in it, stabbed you in it
Slut!
So when you're driving
Driving to his house
And you pass me
While I'm drivin' to hers
Just remember
You cheated on me first (Bitch!)
You're a whore, you're a whore (Eminem!)
This is war (Fellas, ladies)
We could do revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge together, together, together (Ha-ah!)
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet (So sweet, oh-oh)
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)
We could do revenge revenge, revenge
Revenge together, together, together (Uh-uh-uh)
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet

Fuck yeah!
Fuck no!57Embed
