Monsters Lyrics
Why do all the monsters come out at night?
Why do we sleep where we want to hide?
Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?

Another day, 'nother headache in this hangover hotel
Gettin' used to the rhythm, yeah, I know this beat too well
Tunnel visions got me feeling like you're the only one I see
But I know what's missing when I'm swimmin'
In my lonely luxury

I'm wondering, why do all the monsters come out at night?
Why do we sleep where we want to hide?
Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?
Why am I a sucker for all your lies?
Strung out like laundry on every line
Why do I come back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?

I'm addicted to the way you hurt, the way you contradict me
I swear everything look worse at night, I think I'm overthinking
I don't care who I might hurt along the way, I'm fuckin' sinking
Into every word, I don't care if you're lyin' when I'm drinking, so
Tell me pretty lies, look me in my face
Tell me that you love me, even if it's fake
And you can lead me on and leave these questions in my sheets
I'm under it, I made my bed and I'm still wonderin'
I'm wondering, why do all the monsters come out at night?
Why do we sleep where we want to hide?
Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?
Why am I a sucker for all your lies?
Strung out like laundry on every line
Why do I come back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?

Thinkin' about you, you're in my head
Even without you, I still feel dead
Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?
Dead, thinking about you, you're in my head
Even without you, I still feel dead
Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?

I'm wondering, why do all the monsters come out at night?
Why do we sleep where we want to hide? (Hide)
Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?
Why am I a sucker for all your lies?
Strung out like laundry on every line
Why do I come back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life? (Fuck up my life)

Like I don't mind if you fuck up my life23Embed
