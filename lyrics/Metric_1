Black Sheep Lyrics
Black sheep, come home
Black sheep, come home
Black sheep, come home
Black sheep, come home
Black sheep, come home
Black sheep, come home
Black sheep, come home
Black sheep, come home
Black sheep, come home
Black sheep, come home
Black sheep, come home
Black sheep, come home
Black sheep, come home
Black sheep, come home
Black sheep, come home
Black sheep, come home

Hello again
Friend of a friend, I knew you when
Our common goal was waiting for the world to end
Now that the truth is just a rule that you can bend
You crack the whip, shape-shift and trick, the past again

I'll send you my love on a wire
Lift you up, every time
Everyone, ooh
Pulls away, ooh
From you
Got balls of steel
Got an automobile
For a minimum wage
Got real estate
I'm buying it all up in outer space
Now that the truth is just a rule that you can bend
You crack the whip, shape-shift and trick, the past again

I'll send you my love on a wire
Lift you up, every time
Everyone, ooh
Pulls away, ooh
It's a mechanical bull, the number one
You'll take a ride from anyone
Everyone wants a ride
Pulls away, ooh, from you27Embed
