Race for the Prize Lyrics
Two scientists are racing
For the cure of all mankind
Both of them side by side
So determined
Locked in heated battle
For the cure that is their prize
But it's so dangerous
But they're determined

Theirs is to win
If it kills them
They're just humans
With wives and children

Upwards to the vanguard
Where the pressure is so high
Under the microscope
Hope against hope
Forging for the future
But to sacrifice their lives
Both of them side by side
So determined
Theirs is to win
If it kills them
They're just humans
With wives and children
Theirs is to win
If it kills them
They're just humans
With wives and children1Embed
