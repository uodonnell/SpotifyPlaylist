Beat It Lyrics
Kingston
Breezy, right
Let 'em know
Hey

He ain't fly enough (He ain't fly)
He don't even drive, no (He don't drive)
That's why you're calling my phone (My Phone)
And won't leave me alone (Yeah, yeah)
He ain't even fly though (He ain't fly)
You ain't gotta lie, no (Don't lie)
That's why you're calling my phone
And you're wanting me to get, get, get it
Beat, beat, beat it, beat, beat, beat it
You wanting me to beat, beat, beat it
Beat, beat, beat it, beat, beat, beat it
Not a problem, baby
Beat, beat, beat it, beat, beat, beat it
You wanting me to beat, beat (Say what?)
Beat, beat, beat it, beat, beat, beat it (Yeah, yeah)
Beat, beat (1, 2, 3, Go!)

I've been out here looking for a girl like you
So already settled down and loyal to your dude
You-you-you-you got your eyes on me, and girl, he got his eyes on you
My eyes are on this money and it's nothing he can do (About it)
He ain't fly enough (He ain't fly)
He don't even drive, no (He don't drive)
That's why you're calling my phone (My Phone)
And won't leave me alone (Yeah, yeah)
He ain't even fly though (He ain't fly)
You ain't gotta lie, no (Don't lie)
That's why you're calling my phone
And you're wanting me to get, get, get it
Beat, beat, beat it, beat, beat, beat it
You wanting me to beat, beat, beat it
Beat, beat, beat it, beat, beat, beat it
Not a problem, baby
Beat, beat, beat it, beat, beat, beat it
You wanting me to beat, beat (Yeah)
Beat, beat, beat it, beat, beat, beat it (Yeah, yeah)
Beat, beat (Mandem)

You've been out here looking for a guy like me (Yeah)
And I ain't never settled down, just loyal to my team
You got your eyes on me, girl and I got my eyes on green
Your nigga, he so bummy, need to a boost his self-esteem

Cause he ain't fly enough (He ain't fly)
He don't even drive, no (Don't drive) (He don't drive)
That's why you're calling my phone (My Phone)
And won't leave me alone (Yeah, yeah)
He ain't even fly though (He ain't fly)
You ain't gotta lie, no (Girl, please don't lie)
That's why you're calling my phone
And you're wanting me to get, get, get it
Beat, beat, beat it, beat, beat, beat it (Yeah, yeah)
You wanting me to beat, beat, beat it (Let me me beat it up)
Beat, beat, beat it, beat, beat, beat it (Baby, you want me to)
Not a problem, baby
Beat, beat, beat it, beat, beat, beat it (Beat it up)
You wanting me to beat, beat (Beat it up)
Beat, beat, beat it, beat, beat, beat it (Yeah, yeah)
Beat, beat (Fi di gyal dem!)
Uh, you say you want a fly nigga
Roll something and get high, nigga
I'm spending all the moss
And if he ain't coming close, it's time that you tell him bye
I'll take you up in the sky, we'll be floating
Get you wet, like the ocean
I'm-I'm-I'ma speed up on it
If your pussy was a book, I would read up on it
Girl, I'm just trying to get you back to my crib
Seen all them Instagram pictures you post
So I already know what it is
Talk to me now

Cause he ain't fly enough (He ain't fly)
He don't even drive, no (Don't drive) (He don't drive)
That's why you're calling my phone (My Phone)
And won't leave me alone (Yeah, yeah)
He ain't even fly though (He ain't fly)
You ain't gotta lie, no (Girl, please don't lie)
That's why you're calling my phone
And you're wanting me to get, get, get it
Beat, beat, beat it, beat, beat, beat it (Yeah, yeah)
You wanting me to beat, beat, beat it (Let me me beat it up)
Beat, beat, beat it, beat, beat, beat it (Baby, you want me to)
Not a problem, baby
Beat, beat, beat it, beat, beat, beat it (Beat it up)
You wanting me to beat, beat (Beat it up)
Beat, beat, beat it, beat, beat, beat it (Yeah, yeah)
Beat, beat (Fi di gyal dem!)24Embed
