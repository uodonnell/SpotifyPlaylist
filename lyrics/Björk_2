Pagan Poetry Lyrics
Pedalling through
The dark currents
I find an accurate copy
A blueprint of the pleasure in me

(Swirling black lilies totally ripe)
A secret code carved
A secret code carved (Swirling black lilies totally ripe)

He offers a handshake
Crooked five fingers
They form a pattern
Yet to be matched

On the surface simplicity (Swirling black lilies totally ripe)
But the darkest pit in me
And it's pagan poetry (Swirling black lilies totally ripe)
Pagan poetry

Morse coding signals (Signals)
They pulsate (They wake me up)
They wake me up
(Pulsate) from my hibernating
On the surface simplicity (Swirling black lilies totally ripe)
But the darkest pit in me
And it's pagan poetry (Swirling black lilies totally ripe)
Pagan poetry
(Swirling black lilies totally ripe)
(Swirling black lilies totally ripe)

I love him, I love him
I love him, I love him
I love him, I love him
I love him, I love him, I
(She loves him, she loves him)
This time (She loves him, she loves him)
I'm gonna keep it to myself (She loves him, she loves him)
(She loves him, she loves him)
This time (She loves him, she loves him)
I'm gonna keep me all to myself (She loves him, she loves him)
(She loves him, she loves him)
(She loves him, she loves him)
But he makes me want to hand myself over (She loves him, she loves him)
(She loves him, she loves him)
(She loves him, she loves him)
(She loves him, she loves him)
But he makes me want to hand myself over (She loves him, she loves him)
(She loves him, she loves him)
(She loves him, she loves him)
(She loves him, she loves him)36Embed
